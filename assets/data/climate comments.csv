Michael,MacCracken,143986,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,5,5,8,8,Need to close parenthesis,Thank you for the comment. The text has been updated.
Michael,MacCracken,143987,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,5,5,14,15,"What is meant by ""resulting temperature change"". Is this the global average being talked about? And why onlytemperature change--what about other climate variables, what about sea level rise, ocean acidification? I don'tunderstand what is meant.","Thank you for your comment. While the draft text was not intended to be exhaustive, we have revised the textto read, ""and the resulting impacts, including temperature change or sea level rise."" to help clarify this."
Michael,MacCracken,143988,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,5,5,20,30,"Might it be useful here for the general reader to give an indication of what changes in radiative forcing lead to byexplaining that, roughly, when multiplied by the climate sensitivity, the result at equilibrium is the change inglobal average temperature resulting from the change in the atmospheric concentrations? There is a couple ofnew papers that compare model performance to observations (one with respect to radiative flux changes at thetop of the atmosphere, and one with respect to the seasonal cycle) that seek to narrow the uncertaintiesregarding the climate sensitivity--so a range could be given. I just think expecting the average reader tounderstand what radiative forcing is an means may be a bit too scientific and an attempt needs to be made togive a better sense of the significance of RF changes. One could then also mention the temperature objectivesof Paris Accord, again to provide some context on what large and small changes in temperature are.","Thank you for the comment. Upon further review, the authors have elected to move much of the technical detailto the Data Tools and Scenarios Products Appendix."
Michael,MacCracken,143989,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,2,5,"I don't like the characterization of the scenarios by saying ""higher"",  ""lower,"" and ""very low"". First of all, it is notmade clear what these terms apply to--namely emissions, radiative forcing, amount of climate change, what.Second, the term  choices are really implicitly policy judgments--and the report is not to be about policy--it couldbe that there are technological developments that make achieving ""very low"" easy enough to go considerablyfurther, and indeed if climate impacts are to be avoided, there really is a need to go lower. The IPCC 1.5 SpecialReport first draft basically accepted that the Paris temperature objectives were acceptable stabilization levels--while this may be what present negotiators are thinking, as the Hansen et al. paper of a couple of years ago, at1.5 C, the impacts on society would be tremendous (e.g., the paleoclimate derived sea level sensitivity issomething like 15-20 METERS per degree warming--are the negotiators really accepting that as the fate forhumanity; and actually they would be accepting worse as they allow for significant temperature overshoots andit is not at all clear that the ice sheet losses would be irreversible). It seems to me that the names for thescenarios need to be more meaningful, either by naming them based on the equilibrium temperature they implyby 2100 or by naming them based on key policy actions relating to them. So RCP8.5 is unrestrained use of fossilfuels during the 21st century; RCP4.5 is a gradual phasedown of fossil fuels starting in the second half of the 21stcentury; RCP2.6 is a gradual phaseout of fossil fuels during the second half of the 21st century. Or somethinglike that. In any case, I don't think the particular names proposed in the report are policy neutral.","Thank you for your comment. Authors deliberated extensively on how to best label these scenarios in anaccessible manner. Pinning a specific temperature on these would be misleading, as that is not what the RCPscapture; that is a model output driven by the RCPs."
Michael,MacCracken,143990,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,5,7,"While consistency is helpful, it might well have been helpful to encouraging action to limit emissions if theimpacts associated with a RCP2.6 scenario (or an even faster phaseout of emissions) had been considered, soshowing the value of taking action.","Thank you for your comment. In the interest of brevity and clarity, we have limited the number of RCPsconsidered, but have encouraged authors to use RCP2.6 where the literature allows and it adds sufficient newinformation to the assessment. The text explains this, so the authors have not made any additional revisions."
Michael,MacCracken,143991,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,13,18,"Again, I think referring to scenarios by, essentially, policy relevant names is unfortunate--and I think usingradiative forcing as a metric for discussing scenarios with the public is rather linguistically obscure (with aparagraph this obscure in the Front Matter, I'd suggest one is likely to be turning off the general reader). I'dsuggest using names more associated with what the scenario involves in terms of the ongoing dependence ofthe energy system on fossil fuels and when and to what degree they are phased down or out. I think this wouldgive the reader a much better sense of how what happens to the energy system relates to what happens tothem. At the very least, have a box that makes the associations clear in this document (and not throughreferences to documents people tend not to have or won't look at) and choose names for them, so somethinglike: ""FF forever"" for ""higher""; ""FF phasedown"" for ""lower"", and ""FF phaseout"" for ""very low"". And it wouldreally help to have some sort of schematic graphic or table that indicated for each scenario what would behappening over the following periods: 2020-40; 2040-2080; and 2080-and beyond or something like that foreach scenario.","Thank you for your comment. Characterizing the RCPs with what they imply for, say, fossil fuel use, is limiting.For example, if CO2 removal technologies were to become pervasive, RCP2.6 could - theoretically - still beachieved under a fossil fuel-intensive  future. We have inserted the following statement to direct the reader toother resources for additional information: ""For additional detail on these scenarios and what they represent,please see Appendix 3 (Data Tools and Scenario Products), as well as Chapter 4 of the Climate Science SpecialReport (USGCRP 2017)."""

I also wonder if ""migration"" is the rightword here--that makes it seem as if people are moving to some attractive location when actually I wouldsuspect what is meant is forced relocation, so perhaps it would be better to say ""dislocation"" or ""forcedemigration"" or something. And are not the land use changes also driven in part by the changes in climate?Again, a schematic chart might help here as again, this is a pretty complex paragraph for the general reader(even for the technical reader), especially given it is in the front material.","Thank you for your comment.

Michael,MacCracken,143993,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,28,28,"It needs to be explained what the basis was for this grouping.

Michael,MacCracken,143994,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,30,30,"Isn't the whole analysis framed in terms of risk assessment? There are risks associated with all situations andcases, and would be with all of the proposed scenarios, both in terms of the impacts that result for theenvironment and society and also then for the impacts and risks associated with choosing a particular policypath or not (so phasing down FF too fast may risk high prices for energy or limited supplies, etc.)","Thank you for your comment.

If, as noted here, the origins of the climate and sea levelproducts are completely different than the origins of the population, demographic and land use products, I wouldsuggest not having them listed together on lines 23-27 and have a schematic diagram showing their differentorigins and then coming together for the analysis here.","Thank you for your comment.

Michael,MacCracken,143997,Text Region,00. Front Matter,,6,6,35,35,"""These"" is really not very clear here--even saying ""These products"" would be a bit limiting. How aboutspecifically here mentioning that, as the basis for this assessment, the climate- and sea level-related results forvarious scenarios for GHG-related emissions (which were developed by the physical and biological sciencecommunities) were brought together with economic- and population/demographic-related products that werethe drivers of the energy technology scenarios that led to the GHG-related emissions scenarios (which weredeveloped by the economic- and social science communities). So, basically better spell out the inputs--and thenperhaps indicate that the assessment looks at how each set of products might further affect the other set ofproducts and together they will provide plausible projections for what lies ahead given alternative policy choices.I'd suggest while the language may be complicated, showing the linkages in a schematic diagram might be theeasiest way to convey all of this information.","Thank you for the comment.

Uncertainty and confidence can both be spoken of as having degreesof them, but not certainty. The recent Carbon Cycle Report draft was quite inconsistent about this, as I pointedout in quite a number of comments. Here, if you want to have a word for the combination of confidence andlikelihood, how about replacing ""degree of certainty"" with something drawn from the following: overallreliability, conviction, assurance, dependability, trustworthiness, or even certitude.

Just a couple of specificcomments. I am confused by the about equal sign under ""As Likely as Not""--and then nothing on the otherentries. It seems to me it would be better for all of the entries to have the ""approximate"" sign, so ""~"" (and it canperhaps be combined with the greater or less than sign instead of the single bar meaning equal as that impliestoo much exactitude.

(It doesn‰Ûatspeak well for the diligence of previous reviewers.) You are conflating observation and attribution.‰ÛÏObservational evidence‰Ûon its own does not provide any explanation one way or the other forattribution of climate change. Attribution is done through modeling studies, principally by using GCM-generatedforcing series to decompose observed data into additive components (solar, GHG, etc). Later in the report youshow, and rely on, the results of such an exercize. A line on a graph that shows the purported GHG contribution totemperature increase is not ‰ÛÏobservational‰Û, it is the output of a statistical model that takes as inputsobserved data plus forcing measures derived from climate models. The best you can say at this point in thereport is ‰ÛÏGlobal average temperature as measured using surface thermometers increased by about 1.7 oFfrom 1901 to 2016.

Jim,Bouldin,142028,Text Region,"00a. Climate ScienceFindings",,17,18,38,5,"Paragraph 10. Regarding ‰ÛÏself-reinforcing cycles within the climate system‰Û, in Paragraph 1 yourargument depends on the claim that natural variability is known to be minimal on all time scales because itdoesn‰Ûat manifest itself in climate models, therefore modern warming can only be anthropogenic. Yet in thisparagraph you claim the climate is prone to large, persistent natural swings that models can‰Ûat reproduce,which contradicts your earlier claim. You state that models have a ‰ÛÏsystematic tendency to underestimatetemperature change during past warm periods‰Ûwhich obviously implies that they could systematicallyunderestimate natural warming during the present period as well; yet nine paragraphs earlier your assertionrequired you to assume this could not be the case. You can‰Ûat have it both ways.You treat the failure of models to reproduce past warming as evidence that future anthropogenic warming maybe worse than expected. But if models could be made to account for past variability through improvements thatyield a greater tendency to exhibit natural warming trends, it might require a revision of the attribution ofmodern warming in such a way as to imply a lower greenhouse gas sensitivity, which would imply that future(anthropogenic) warming will be less than currently expected. In other words, the information in this paragraphcan support two opposite conclusions. By emphasising only one you exhibit bias.I can‰Ûat suggest how to reword this paragraph. It is likely true that models suppress natural variability inorder to prevent drift and low-frequency instability (see, for instance, the discussion in Bereiter et al. Nature 2018about the inability of climate models to reproduce the large swings in the Younger Dryas event). Butacknowledging that fact will require you to acknowledge the weakness of your attribution arguments, whichpresuppose that GCMs provide a valid representation of natural variability on all time scales.","We disagree with the reviewer's comment as it conflates natural variability over decadal timescales, which is thetopic of NCA4 Vol. 1 Chapter 2, with the response of the Earth's climate system to long-term warming overcenturies to millennia, which is the topic of NCA4 Vol. 1 Chapter 15.

Michael,MacCracken,144037,Text Region,00b. Report Findings,,21,21,15,15,"Is not the agricultural economy in the US really booming? What is threatened are the small farmers who areincreasingly facing conditions that they cannot, as individuals, really deal with. So, the overall economy doeswell, but individual farmers suffer. I think this is what we came up with in the first national assessment--and it isa real distinction to be made. When individual farmers tend to keep to their practices, they end up becoming toopoor (through successive bad years) to have the resources to change to new practices, so they go broke andsuffer and some newcomer comes (perhaps for a big company) and takes over and starts up with differentpractices until they too get overcome by the changes. So, the economy does okay, but the individual farmerssuffer. [Given IPCC sometimes has said that productivity of US agriculture is projected to increase, one has toexplain how climate change can be bad for at least some of those involved and the communities they live in.]Also, climate change modifies competitive relationships among regions, and who can grow each crop most costefficiently and reliably, and so adaptation is not just to the particular situation for a particular farm, but also hasto consider the national and international farm economies and changing cost and other advantages anddisadvantages, requiring ongoing evaluation of all sorts of information that can really complicate the situationsfaced by farmers and is sure to lead to more and more challenges and failures (and if all farmers in a regionhappen to make the same bad decision, then overall performance can be affected, etc.). Really important to beclear on difference between overall economy and the well-being and success of particular farmers and particularregional agricultural economies.","We have added text on changes in the  viability of particular agricultural enterprises in regions.

What Iunderstand is more seriously threatened is likely overall production of the collective agriculture industry ratherthan yield (it will likely be good in some locations and situations and not in others). And the difference betweeneffects on yield versus overall production needs to be clearly made because how one responds to each type ofchallenge is different.","The agriculture chapter finds that ""yields from major U.S. commodity crops are expected to decline as aconsequence of higher temperatures,"" so no change has been made.

This text is also meant to compensate for theinconsistent use of descriptive vocabulary when applied to societal and policy considerations, as well as whenapplied with different meanings across the scientific disciplines of the chapter topics. Despite the well-definedlanguage of uncertainty and likelihood, the ability to apply those concepts for decision-making is assumptivewith the report.   The glossary noted in the references is of limited help for this audience because of its erring onthe side of generalized definitions.In terms of consistency, the term ""risk"" as used in the report, may have the meaning of 1) consequence, 2)threats, or 3) the formal probability times expected (tangible) consequence.  Similarly, the potentiallysynonymous words ""variability,"" ""volatility"" and ""deviation"" are used with particular (discipline-centric) meaningwithout enabling the reader to understand the distinctions.  The very useful terminology of exceedanceprobability (Chapter 16) is used without context. To help readers comprehend the risks and adaptive response,the use of ""exceedance probability"" would be helpful in many chapters.Resilience and adaptation are often used interchangeably without regard for what is physically meant by eitherterm. In a multidisciplinary work, the variation in word usage among the chapters is unavoidable, but thebenefits of an integrated picture outweigh those pitfalls. Again, giving initial context would make the documentmore useful to intelligent, but non-scientist policy makers.  It is impractical, if not impossible to harmonize thechapter to chapter verbalization, but it is very doable to forearm readers with tools that maximize their take-away understanding of the reports content across all chapters relevant to them.Climate change affects many aspects of the physical world. Understanding those dynamics and their impactsrequire the composite contributions that the many disciplines brought together in this report. Each discipline usesits own language and methods, all related but distinct. In many instances, the consequences of climate changeare more across the intersection points of the domains, each noted as a chapter within the report, than within the","We have added this definition of risk to the new Box 1.2 (Evaluating Risks to Inform Decisions), which comesfrom the USGCRP Glossary (https://www.globalchange.gov/climate-change/glossary): ""In this report, risks areoften defined in a qualitative sense as threats to life, health and safety, the environment, economic well-being,and other things of value to society. In some cases, risks are described in quantitative terms—estimates of howlikely a given threat is to occur (probability) and the damages that would result if it did happen (consequences).""Moreover, wwe have taken some of the proposed text in this comment to inform the large-scale re-write of theRisk Box in the Overview (Box 1.2)"

In order forsolar, volcanic, or orbital changes to explain current temperature trends, we would need to have underestimatedthe climate's response to such changes by orders of magnitude and, in some cases, have gotten the sign wrong.This conclusion is at odds with paleoclimate evidence.

Ross,McKitrick,143111,Text Region,"01. Overview /Executive Summary",,30,30,11,16,"It is misleading to say ""No combination of natural factors is found in the observational record that would accountfor the current warming trend."" You are referring to Figure 1.2 which does not show observations (except for thepink line), it shows model-generated outputs. You can claim that this model decomposes observed changes insuch-and-such a way based on the way forcings are represented in the model and the way natural variability isrepresented, and that this decomposition implies that greenhouse gases play such-and-such a role. But youshould acknowledge that the validity of the decomposition rests on the assumed validity of the climate model.You cannot claim that the colored lines are ""observational""because they are not. Doing so conflates observationand attribution.","It is true that we have no observations of the climate's response to natural and anthropogenic forcing agents inisolation.  Thus, we must rely on models to separate the effects of different forcings.  These climate models,however, incorporate the current scientific understanding of how the climate responds to external forcings.  Farfrom being misleading, this sentence reflects the current state of the science.  It does not imply the non-blacklines in Figure 1.2 are observations. For more detail on climate model performance and evaluation, the reader isdirected to Chapter 2 and NCA4 Volume I - Climate Science Special Report (specifically Chapter 4.3).

Ross,McKitrick,143112,Text Region,"01. Overview /Executive Summary",,31,32,1,27,"Why does the red shading end 7 years before the black line?You are placing a great deal of weight on this diagram which is a very weak form of argumentation. While it is asuperficially persuasive picture, there are at least three problems with the argument.First, you have assumed that the models are accurate representations of climate processes, which is an unsafeassumption. There is a large literature on climate model testing which you have completely ignored. A recentexample is Beenstock, Reingewertz and Paldor (2016) ""Testing the historical tracking of climate models""International Journal of Forecasting http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016920701630053X.This paper points out that if a model's match to target observations is genuine rather than spurious, hindcasterrors must be stationary and exhibit a mean-reversion property. But the difference between climate modelestimates of the global mean surface temperature and the observed GMST values (from GISS) is in all casesnonstationary and non-mean reverting. That paper also reviews related literature on this question from avariety of authors applying a variety of methods, with the recurring result that climate models fail to reproducekey statistical features of target observations, which means they are not suitable as forecasting tools. Theimplication is that you cannot boast about how good your models are when the expert modeling literature hasshown that they have systematic problems reproducing essential properties of the target variables.Another important study in this regard is Swanson, K.L., 2013. Emerging selection bias in large-scale climatechange simulations. Geophysical Research Letters, 40, DOI: 10.1002/grl.50562, which shows that betweenCMIP3 and CMIP5, GCMs became more like each other but less like the observations. That they no longeroverlap with key metrics of surface temperature trends and temperature extremes, and to the extent they yieldimproved fit with some metrics (like Arctic temperatures) they are likely getting that metric right for the wrongreasons.Second, the corresponding Figure would fail dramatically in the lower and mid-troposphere, even though theinfluence of GHGs is supposedly amplified there. We know this because the figure showing it is in IPCC 2013 Ch10 Fig 10SM.1 (see http://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/supplementary/WG1AR5_Ch10SM_FINAL.pdf).  The same sort of decomposition is shown asin your Figure 1.2, except in more detail by showing vertical layers by latitude band. In most cases theobservational line rests outside (i.e. below) the GHG-only and combined forcings range and within the ‰ÛÏno-","Climate models have been extensively tested and evaluated (the reader is directed to Chapter 2 of the report, aswell as NCA4 Volume I - Climate Science Special Report, particularly Chapter 4.3), and while they are not perfect,they are the best research tools currently available.  There is no unique metric of model performance, and thebinary ""good/bad"" distinction fails to evaluate whether models are fit for a particular purpose.  A vast literatureon model evaluation and diagnosis, the coordinated framework provided by the Coupled Model IntercomparisonProject, and a large body of observations can guide decision-making and model selection.  It is simply not truethat the research literature has shown that models are not ""good"".   Biases and errors in many variables havebeen identified by multiple studies, and model improvement is an ongoing process.  Climate models will neverbe exact reproductions of reality, but they incorporate the basic physics and chemistry that dictate climateresponse.  There is high confidence that models produce credible estimates of future change; IPCC WG1 AR5 Ch8 as well as Chapter 2 of this report and NCA4 Vol I (Climate Science Special Report) discuss the reasons why."

This is promotional hype. You provide no evidence of the ""remarkable accuracy""of climate models, and ignore the many publications showing how bad they are. For example:Koutsoyiannis, D., A. Efstratadis, N. Namassis and A. Christofides (2008) ""On the credibility of climatepredictions"" Hydrological Sciences, 53(4) August 2008Anagnostopoulos, G. G., D. Koutsoyiannis, A.

Climate Dynamics, DOI 10.1007/s00382-012-1418-9.Koutsoyiannis et al. (2008) and Anagnostopoulos et al. (2010) compared long term (100-year) temperature andprecipitation trends in a total of 55 locations around the world to model projections. The models performed quitepoorly at the annual level, but they also did poorly even when averaged up to the 30-year scale, even thoughyou say this is the level GCMs work best at. They also did no better over larger and larger regional scales. Theauthors concluded that there is no basis for the claim that climate models are well-suited for long termpredictions over large regions.Fildes et al. (2011) took the same data set and compared model predictions against a ""random walk""alternative, consisting simply of using the last period's value in each location as the forecast for the next period'svalue in that location. The test measures the sum of errors relative to the random walk. A perfect model gets ascore of zero, meaning it made no errors. A model that does no better than a random walk gets a score of 1. Amodel receiving a score above 1 did worse than uninformed guesses. Simple statistical forecast models thathave no climatology or physics in them typically got scores between 0.8 and 1, indicating slight improvementson the random walk, though in some cases their scores went as high as 1.8. The CMIP3 climate models gotscores ranging from 2.4 to 3.7, indicating a complete failure to provide valid forecast information at the regional","This statement about model accuracy is based on an extensive assessment of the literature, most recentlysummarized in Chapter 2 of this assessment, as well as in the entire Volume I of NCA4 (Climate Science SpecialReport).  In particular, Chapter 4.3 of NCA4 Vol I reads: ""Confidence in the usefulness of the future projectionsgenerated by global climate models is based on multiple factors. These include the fundamental nature of thephysical processes they represent, such as radiative transfer or geophysical fluid dynamics, which can be testeddirectly against measurements or theoretical calculations to demonstrate that model approximations are valid(e.g., IPCC 1990 ). They also include the vast body of literature dedicated to evaluating and assessing modelabilities to simulate observed features of the earth system, including large-scale modes of natural variability, andto reproduce their net response to external forcing that captures the interaction of many processes whichproduce observable climate system feedbacks (e.g., Flato et al. 2013 ). There is no better framework forintegrating our knowledge of the physical processes in a complex coupled system like Earth’s climate.""

Overview /Executive Summary",,39,39,4,8,"You say ""It's important to note that climate model projections are, broadly speaking, not designed to directlycapture every annual or even decadal variation in a historical record. Rather, since ""climate"" is defined asweather conditions over multiple decades (for example, over periods of 30 years), climate model projections areaimed more towards capturing long-term changes.""Then why do you so often focus on short term weather phenomena in this report, such as the 2017 hurricaneseason?

No they don't. Domestic mitigation and even global mitigationon a scale like the Kyoto and Paris treaties would not affect the time path of warming. There are no policyproposals on the table that would substantially change the rate of accumulation of GHG's in the atmosphere.You need to point out that your figures are, at best, *gross* benefits since you are not taking account of thecosts of the policies necessary to achieve the mitigation. Neither are you discounting those benefits to thepresent, which is important since the impacts warned of in the 1st NCA have unfolded far more slowly thanforecast and this will likely be true of your edition as well, meaning the effects of GHG emissions won't beincurred until a century or more down the road. Hence the discounted gross benefits you describe are tiny andfar in the future, and (to put them in perspective) are dwarfed many times over by recent annual variations inthe US federal budget deficit, and stock market fluctuations.","The reviewer did not provide supporting information or literature to support their comments regarding theadequacy of domestic or global mitigation efforts in affecting long-term changes in warming or atmosphericconcentrations of GHGs.

The discussion can also consider to incorporate understanding ofanthropogenic drivers of climate change from the social science perspectives. For example, the IPCC AR5 WGIIIhas a chapter on drivers of climate change (Blanco et al. 2014). More recently, the USGCRP Social ScienceCoordinating Committee has coordinated three White Papers Social Science Perspectives on Climate Changewhich includes one paper on ""Drivers of and Responses to Climate Change"" (USGCRP 2018 - upcoming).

Shaye,Wolf,143626,Text Region,"01. Overview /Executive Summary",,24,24,3,15,"The opening paragraph of the Introduction fails to appropriately convey the magnitude of current and projecteddamage caused by climate change, and fails to convey an appropriate sense of urgency and seriousness aboutthe need for action.The first sentence ""Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in human history"" uses the neutralword ""change"" and fails to attribute this change to its primary cause: greenhouse gas pollution from the burningof fossil fuels. The opening sentences must make clear that the primary cause of climate change is humanactivities, primarily burning oil, gas, and coal, rather than a vague statement. Similarly, the second sentence usesthe neutral words ""impacts"" and ""affect"" rather than ""damage"" or ""harm"" or ""negative impacts."" It is alsounclear what ""Americans are responding"" means.  Many Americans are limited in their ability to ""respond""orcope with climate change - especially the elderly, young, sick, poor, and some communities of color.The final sentence of the opening paragraph implies that Americans are handling climate change and thateverything will be okay at current response levels:""Americans are responding to change in ways that can reduceclimate-related risks, bolster resilience to change, and improve livelihoods."" Nothing could be farther from thetruth. Although some states and local communities are undertaking mitigation and adaptation actions, currentUS climate policy is completely inadequate to avoid dangerous levels of atmospheric GHG concentrations andassociated dangerous impacts from warming, extreme weather events, sea level rise, ocean acidification,species extinction, glacier/ice sheet/sea ice loss and the like. The US must take much stronger, bold, and urgentaction to reduce GHG gas pollution to avoid unacceptable damage, and this message should be clear from thevery first paragraph onward.We strongly recommend that you change the opening paragraph so that it accurately represents the currentstate of the science on climate change damage and risks, for example:  ""Earth's climate is now changing fasterthan at any point in human history, and the primary cause is greenhouse gas pollution created by burning oil,coal, and natural gas.

Overview /Executive Summary",,35,35,12,14,"A phrase very much like ""no detectable change"", which really means we don't have evidence yet that gives us20 to 1 confidence that a change has occurred, was at the root of the extensive controversy over the statementin the IPCC Second Assessment Report regarding detection of a discernible human influence. Basically, thephrase is obscuring how there has been a choice (traditional in the statistical and physical science community,but not generally in the public or in government decision-making arenas). This ""choice"" is really a value-baseddecision (indicating that there is a predilection of scientists in making decisions to not being wrong) that needs tobe made apparent to the public/reader. To really convey what is understood, I'd suggest re-wording thesentence here to say: ""Because the observational record is limited to only ~150 years and because theoccurrence of drought is irregular, high statistical confidence that droughts are becoming more likely has not yetbeen possible to achieve, but there is strong evidence that the higher temperatures resulting from humaninfluences are leading to deeper surface moisture deficits, which is a closely related indicator of drought-likeconditions.""","While the intent behind this comment has merit, the proposed revision to the text is quite lengthy and it providesa level of technical detail that is not consistent with the rest of the Overview.

Instead, climate model projections are intended to capture long-term changes, such as how theclimate system will respond to changes in greenhouse gas levels over this century. Scientists test climate modelsby comparing them to current observations and historical changes. Confidence in these models is based, in part,on how well they reproduce these observed changes.

Alessandra,Jerolleman,144778,"WholeChapter","01. Overview /Executive Summary",,,,,,"Overall, the organization of the chapter is not structured effectively.  Looking at the audience of interest for anoverview, the majority of the audience will be looking for the strongest points in beginning section.  This paperappears to garner this interest by posing the issue of climate change as a threat to economic stability and a riskto human health and safety.  The tone of the overview gives the impression that this is one of the primaryreasons for national and international concern and action.  However, the beginning section begins with asynp[sis of the status and extent of climate change.  These facts are not irrelevant and should most definitelyremain in the overview.  However, because of the primary argument being risk assessment based, this shouldbe placed at the forefront of the overview.The structured choice of repeating the main titles of ""Weather and Climate"", ""Snow and Ice"", ""Land and Water"",and ""Oceans and Coasts"" is not helpful to the reader.  The overview should instead include major headings thatindicate the argument and not the region of interest.   Much of the information in the first and second section ofthese chapters feels repetitive because of the structure.  It also gives the impression to the reader that there isless evidence then in actuality if the same information and style of presentation are repetitive in this manner.Overall, the language is very strong and the information is well pieced together.  The real issue in this overviewis structure and organization.  In the overview, it is critical that the language, arguments, and factual informationare well constructed and contain minimal tangents.  Breaking up the walls of text with more visuals would beextremely beneficial to extending the reach of this paper to a wider audience.","We have completely re-worked the middle sections of the Overview based on this and other comments - andincluded a number of new graphics, as well.

Geoffrey,Marion,141829,"WholeChapter","02. Our ChangingClimate",,,,,,"1) The chapter delivers a strong and firm grasp of the facts leading to our belief in the changing climate. It goesthrough various facets of climate, i.e. effect of anthropogenic activities on increased amount of carbon dioxideand a net increase in global temperature, decrease in arctic sea ice, widening of tropical belt, increase inprecipitation extremes, changes in oceanic acidity and circulation and changes in the overall global circulation.2) Although, the combination of satellite studies and general circulation models provide a holistic view ofchanging climate, uncertainties due to lack of understanding and hence representation of convective processesin the global scale models can create a significant bias in the results. Therefore, inclusion of uncertainties due toconvective-radiative biases might create a deviation in the report results.

The scientific literature is full of discussions ofpossible natural causes for the observed changes. Moreover, there are numerous studies that suggest thatthese changes are well within the range of natural variability. In fact at least half of the temperature increaseoccurred early in the 20th century, when greenhouse gasses were thought to have little impact.

To begin with there is neither objectivity nor integrity, asthese errors have been pointed out repeatedly during the previous series of National Assessments (referencesshould not be necessary), yet they persist. As a result there is no quality or utility.","This statement is inconsistent with the findings of NCA4 Vol. 1 as summarized in Chapters 1 through 4.Specifically, Vol. 1 states that: “The global climate continues to change rapidly compared to the pace of thenatural variations in climate that have occurred throughout Earth’s history.” (Chapter 1)It also concludes that: “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence hasbeen the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Formal detection and attributionstudies for the period 1951 to 2010 find that the observed global mean surface temperature warming lies in themiddle of the range of likely human contributions to warming over that same period. We find no convincingevidence that natural variability can account for the amount of global warming observed over the industrial era.For the period extending over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations supported by theextent of the observational evidence. Solar output changes and internal variability can only contributemarginally to the observed changes in climate over the last century, and we find no convincing evidence fornatural cycles in the observational record that could explain the observed changes in climate.” (Chapter 1)It additionally finds that: “In the industrial era, human activities have been, and are increasingly, the dominantcause of climate warming. The increase in radiative forcing due to these activities has far exceeded the relativelysmall net increase due to natural factors, which include changes in energy from the sun and the cooling effect ofvolcanic eruptions.” (Chapter 2)Vol. 1 also quantifies the human-induced contribution as follows: “The likely range of the human contribution tothe global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the centralestimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to alikely human contribution of 93%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change. It is extremely likely that morethan half of the global mean temperature increase since 1951 was caused by human influence on climate (highconfidence). The likely contributions of natural forcing and internal variability to global temperature change overthat period are minor (high confidence).” (Chapter 3)"

In reality allhuman emitted carbon dioxide is gone in just a few years. That the increasing atmospheric concentration oftrace carbon dioxide is composed of human emissions is a common fallacy. That NCA4 should assume thisfallacy in its fundamental scientific claims is very worrying.That there is any human-induced warming or that the oceans are absorbing most of it has yet to be determinedand appears increasingly unlikely. Connecting ocean warming to human emissions is pure speculation at thispoint.","This statement is inconsistent with the findings of NCA4 Vol. 1 as summarized in Chapters 1, 12 and 13.As NCA4 Vol.1 states, “Trends in globally averaged temperature, sea level rise, upper-ocean heat content, land-based ice melt, arctic sea ice, depth of seasonal permafrost thaw, and other climate variables provide consistentevidence of a warming planet. These observed trends are robust and have been confirmed by multipleindependent research groups around the world.” More detail is provided in NCA4 Vol. 1 Figure 1.1 and Chapters1, 6, 7, 11, and 12.Vol. 1 also states that: “Many lines of evidence demonstrate that it is extremely likely that human influence hasbeen the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. Formal detection and attributionstudies for the period 1951 to 2010 find that the observed global mean surface temperature warming lies in themiddle of the range of likely human contributions to warming over that same period. We find no convincingevidence that natural variability can account for the amount of global warming observed over the industrial era.For the period extending over the last century, there are no convincing alternative explanations supported by theextent of the observational evidence. Solar output changes and internal variability can only contributemarginally to the observed changes in climate over the last century, and we find no convincing evidence fornatural cycles in the observational record that could explain the observed changes in climate.” (Chapter 1)It additionally finds that: “In the industrial era, human activities have been, and are increasingly, the dominantcause of climate warming. The increase in radiative forcing due to these activities has far exceeded the relativelysmall net increase due to natural factors, which include changes in energy from the sun and the cooling effect ofvolcanic eruptions.” (Chapter 2)Vol. 1 also quantifies the human-induced contribution as follows: “The likely range of the human contribution tothe global mean temperature increase over the period 1951–2010 is 1.1° to 1.4°F (0.6° to 0.8°C), and the centralestimate of the observed warming of 1.2°F (0.65°C) lies within this range (high confidence). This translates to alikely human contribution of 93%–123% of the observed 1951–2010 change. It is extremely likely that more"

All futureprojections correspond to both a higher and a lower future scenario. The Front Matter of Vol. 2 states that, “Forthe sake of brevity and clarity, the Principals of the Subcommittee on Global Change Research (SGCR) decidedthat NCA4 would focus on RCP8.5 as a “higher” scenario and RCP4.5 as a “lower” scenario. Other RCP scenarios(e.g., RCP2.6, a “very low” scenario) may be used where instructive, such as in analyses of mitigation scienceissues. The use of RCP8.5 and RCP4.5 as core scenarios is broadly consistent with the range of scenarios used inthe Third National Climate Assessment (Melillo et al. 2014).”Analysis of projected changes in past assessments have demonstrated that, if anything, such assessments tendto error on the side of under- rather than over-estimating observed change. A number of such analyses havebeen conducted by independent researchers as well as by organizations such as the National Research Council.These assessments are summarized in Brysse et al. (2012), who concluded that: “The available evidencesuggests that scientists have in fact been conservative in their projections of the impacts of climate change. Inparticular, we discuss recent studies showing that at least some of the key attributes of global warming fromincreased atmospheric greenhouse gases have been under-predicted, particularly in IPCC assessments of thephysical science, by Working Group I. We also note the less frequent manifestation of over-prediction of keycharacteristics of climate in such assessments. We suggest, therefore, that scientists are biased not towardalarmism but rather the reverse: toward cautious estimates, where we define caution as erring on the side ofless rather than more alarming predictions.”Brysse, K., N.

Emily,Seyller,142384,"WholeChapter","02. Our ChangingClimate",,,,,,"Melting Sea Ice and Its General EffectsThis chapter thus far seems to do an effective job at communicating to the general public the current state ofclimate change, as well as what the future is predicted to look like in different scenarios. However, there areparts within the draft‰Ûas second chapter which are in need of clarification/explanation to the public crowd.Like many of the general public, I am aware of the rising sea levels due to the melting glaciers. However, with alimited background in chemistry, biochemistry, and ecology, I am confused as to what the direct effects onspecific organisms will be from these rising sea levels. Ch. 2, Page 72, Line 24 states ‰ÛÏIt is very likely that bymid-century the Arctic will be almost entirely free of sea ice by late summer.‰ÛThis wording is confusing.Does it mean that in one specific future late summer the Arctic will be free of sea ice? Or, does it mean thatevery recurring late summer the Arctic will not have any sea ice, and then in the winter and colder months icewill form again? Is there any significance that the water will be salt water that freezes as opposed to freshwater? Clarification of this point would be very helpful in concluding Key Message 7.The Effects of increased Ocean CO2 on Ocean OrganismsThe draft makes clear its prediction of rising sea levels, however fails to address what the projected effects ofincreased CO2 in the ocean will be on oceanic organisms? I would assume increased photosynthesis ofphotolithotrophs living in the ocean, however, what effects might this have on oceanic ecosystems? Will thisdumping of freshwater into the ocean create a problem for current organisms living in a saltwater environment,or is this such a miniscule amount it is insignificant?A Raw Data Draft Devoid of Hope, and Perhaps Too ObjectiveIn so much as this draft presents the facts, raw data, and draws conclusions, it has left me, as part of the generalpublic, feeling slightly hopeless, and my actions insignificant. As a current researcher studying oak tree geneticvariation in order to predict changing range during climate change, I would like to see a glimmer of a tone ofhope conveyed. This report is about being objective, however what good will that be if it has no effect on thepublic? The public needs to feel a sense of urgency, or at least worry, about the state of or climate entering intothe unknown. Yet, at the same time, there is lots being done to study climate change. Aside from predictingwhat will happen without intervention, there is lots being done to determine how we will take further action, howwe can reverse this process, and how we can maintain a high standard of living in an environmentally friendly","Thank you for this comment and the kind remarks on the chapter.While we appreciate the perspective put forward by this reviewer, unfortunately much of what they propose andsuggest is either beyond the scope of this chapter, which focuses very narrowly and exclusively on observed andprojected changes in the physical climate system -- or it is beyond the scope of this report, which does not dealwith aspects of policy response.Regarding their comments on sea ice (which is within the purview of this chapter), the below Key Message 7 hasbeen expanded to explain that the ""ice-free"" threshold would be crossed in late summer; that the metric is astatement of likelihood of this threshold being crossed for the first time in approx. 2 million years; and that seaice will continue to form each winter. Clarification was also added regarding how loss of sea ice affects heatuptake and distribution in the ocean, further enforcing sea ice loss in subsequent years. Note that the fact that itis salt water that is freezing simply lowers the freezing temperature; we do not consider this of sufficientsignificance to point out. Other chapters (Chapter 9: Oceans and Marine Resources and Ch. 26: Alaska) discussin more detail the impacts of sea ice loss to coastal communities and ecosystems."
Amy,Chen,142395,"WholeChapter","02. Our ChangingClimate",,,,,,"I find that Chapter 2 has a number of major and minor problems.1.  Ostensibly, the point of the NCA4 comprising two volumes is so that one could be devoted to describingclimatic changes themselves, and the other (this volume) to the effects thereof.  It is therefore not necessary tore-hash findings findings from Volume I here, and especially given that much of this same, or similar, material isalso repeated in the Executive Summary and the other two preliminary chapters.  This problem is made evenworse by the fact that most of this material is not even specific to the United States.  Together these give thedistinct impression that Volume II does not in fact place its highest priority on describing the climatic state(s) ofthe United States, but rather on using the NCA4 as an excuse to bolster IPCC Assessment Reports and theirconclusions.  This is unacceptable.2.  More specifically, ""Key Messages"" 1 to 4 are focused 100% on the global scale, with no mention of specificsfor the United States whatsoever.  A USA focus does not appear until Messages 5 and 6, which, focusing onprimary climatic variables (T and P) should reasonably be the lead ""Key Messages"" of the chapter.  Other KeyMessages are either at global, or a mix of global and USA, scales.  Key Messages 3 and 4 both deal with theocean and can therefore be combined, and much of that discussion deals either with the open ocean generally,and/or non-climatic effects (ocean acidification).3.  The chapter mixes (1) observations from the past with (2) predictions of the future in a haphazard way, and itis by no means clear which if any of these represent truly new findings since the last NCA in 2014.  Again, re-hashes of various claims of NCA4 Volume 1, or IPCC AR5, or other large scale assessments, do not fulfill the NCAmission/purpose of updating what is known (or believed) about the climate of the United States.  Furthermore,the provenance or data sources for various claims made is very frequently unclear.4.  Box 2.4. The point of this box is incorrect--oviously, what matters is the flux into and out of the atmosphere,not into (i.e. emissions) alone.  Increased sequestration, by whatever means, for a given emission level, will alsoreduces atmospheric accumulation; this is a very basic fact.  There is also no such thing as ""negative emissions"";emissions are positive by definition and the opposite process is sequestration.Furthermore, the paragraph in lines 18-24 is wrong or misleading.  Emissions from the USA, and North America,have been declining for about a decade now, since roughly 2008 or so, not 2014.  This is very clearly shown inthe latest Global Carbon Project annual report and data (GCP, November 2017).  The paragraph appears to be","1. The mandate of NCA4 Volume 1 and NCA4 Volume 2 Chapter 2 is to describe changes to the physical climatesystem at both the relevant global and the national scales, recognizing that global change affects the UnitedStates. This chapter fulfills that mandate.2. Chapter 2 has been specifically organized to present global changes first, then national ones.3. Each section combines observations with future projections for the same variable, mirroring the organizationof NCA4 Volume 1. The reviewer is directed to NCA4 Volume 1 for a clear delineation of what is new relative toNCA3.4. The terminology used in this box is that of the scientific community and the references to global emissions arerelevant because these are what determine climate: not those of the US alone. The reviewer is directed to NCA4Volume 1 Chapter 14 for more information.Both NCA4 Vol. 1 and 2 represent a summary of the state of the science including, where appropriate, anaccurate and representative range of uncertainty in both historical observations and future projections.5. We appreciate the reviewer's opinion but the title of the chapter cannot be changed at this time."

In NCA4 Volume 1, on which this chapter is based, we used a low confidencestatement: ""Potential linkages between the frequency and intensity of severe winter storms in the United Statesand accelerated warming in the Arctic have been postulated, but they are complex, and, to some extent,contested, and confidence in the connection is currently low.""

Ryan,Maue,143378,"WholeChapter","02. Our ChangingClimate",,,,,,"Detailed Review Comments of Chapter 2There is voluminous research discussing the global warming ‰ÛÏhiatus‰Ûor ‰ÛÏpause‰Ûduring the 16-years after the previous strong El Nino 1998-2014, only ended after the most recent uptick in global temperaturein 2015-2017.  While the background trend is clearly warming, the ‰ÛÏstep-like‰Ûincreases in temperaturefollowed by ‰ÛÏpauses‰Ûshould not be glossed over but examined honestly.  From conventionalobservational, satellite, and reanalysis datasets, the global warming coincident with the strong El Nino was over0.2-degrees Celsius, similar but larger than the ‰ÛÏjump‰Û20-years ago.Key Message 1:  Lines 16-23 are not entirely representative of the ongoing research into the ‰ÛÏhiatus‰Û.The inclusion of the Lewandowsky et al. (2016) reference suggests this document is hedging toward‰ÛÏstatistical‰Ûcherry-picking as the reasoning for short-term global warming variability.  Additionally, theKarl et al. (2015) paper includes arguably questionable data methodology choices and a better reference existsusing the ERSSTv5 (Huang et al. 2017).These definitions are needlessly imprecise: ‰ÛÏfrom a few years to a decade or so‰Ûand should be replacedwith exact information about the length of previous ‰ÛÏpauses‰Ûand then ‰ÛÏjumps‰Ûor upticks inwarming.

Simply listing references with competing theories or contradictory conclusions is","This comment should have been broken into separate comments about various sections of Chapter 2 rather thanbeing a Whole Chapter comment. Nonetheless, we will deal with each of the comments one by one.The first comment is that there is a need to further discuss the so-called hiatus. The sentences relating to thehiatus have been rewritten to address this; however, they now also clearly reference the extensive discussion onthe hiatus found in Chapter 1 of  NCA4 Volume I, including the connections to changes in heat uptake during theperiod of the hiatus. A number of studies are referenced here, and others are also discussed in Volume I. TheHuang et al. reference has been added as suggested.The next major comment relates to Key Message 8. This section is by necessity quite short, but the extensivediscussion the reviewer wants to see on the Arctic can be found in Chapter 11 of NCA4 Volume I. Early in thechapter we state that the readers should see NCA4 Volume I formore extensive discussion on the topicsdiscussed in chapter 2 of Volume II.  Similarly, there is more discussion in Volume I on the other extremes,including atmospheric rivers (Chapter 7 of Volume I) and tropical cyclones (Chapter 9). We don’t see a need toinclude Figure S.4 (which is essentially a redrawing of a figure in Wuebbles et al., 2014). We stand behind whatis said in Box 2.5, which was written in close coordination with NOAA scientists."

For example, the highly cited Soden et al(2008) considers the Planck feedback to be one of the radiative feedbacks, so that the net feedback is damping.To be clearer what is meant, we suggest writing ‰ÛÏthe net effect of these feedbacks (excluding the Planckresponse) over the industrial era has been to amplify.‰ÛSoden, B.J., I.M.

As was stated in NCA4 Volume 1:""When the temperatures of Earth’s surface and atmosphere increase in response to RF, more infrared radiationis emitted into the lower atmosphere; this serves to restore radiative balance at the tropopause. This radiativefeedback, defined as the Planck feedback, only partially offsets the positive RF while triggering other feedbacksthat affect radiative balance. The Planck feedback magnitude is −3.20 ± 0.04 W/m2 per 1.8°F (1°C) of warmingand is the strongest and primary stabilizing feedback in the climate system (Vial et al. 2013)."" NCA4 Volume 1,on which this chapter is based, does account for the Planck function.

(1) There is little sinking in the Arctic Ocean, (2) the freshwater budget of the Arctic isnot described correctly, and (3) ocean heat loss is by far the largest contribution to the sinking rate, notfreshwater.Melting sea ice causes no significant annual source of freshwater to the Arctic Ocean. Instead, owing to a largeexport of sea ice out the Fram Strait, there is actually a net loss of freshwater from net annual growth in theArctic Ocean.

Freshwater sources include runoff frommelting land ice, direct precipitation, and export of sea ice and relative freshwater from the Arctic ocean into thenorthern North Atlantic.

Michael,MacCracken,144140,Text Region,"02. Our ChangingClimate",,71,71,8,9,"This is a very cautious projection about sea ice retreat. Given its deteriorated state in mid-summer now, I'dsuggest what is proposed here is likely by no later than 2030 and by 2050 most of the Arctic is likely to be ice-free by most of the summer. The model simulations are tending to lag behind the observed change, indicating asystematic bias (perhaps due to small problems in what the forcing is due to sulfates and other pollutants or forother reasons). In any case, the statement here seems very cautious.","As this is an assessment, key findings statements require a solid and typically broad quantitative basis in theliterature and, as such, tend towards being conservative in their assertions. Although it is certainly possible thatthis statement is overly conservative, it is based on the best data currently available to project future sea icecover: a suite of CMIP5 model runs. While it is true that models have under-predicted recent sea ice decline, wedon't fully know why this is the case, making it difficult to apply an ad-hoc quantitative adjustment to predictedsea ice trends.  Some of the recent decline may have been enhanced by natural variability amplifying thedecline and/or have been driven by processes (e.g. circulation changes) that will not necessarily be maintainedover the coming decades. Thus, simple extrapolation is not a robust basis for predicting with very highconfidence when the Arctic is likely to be ice-free by end of summer. As such, the Key Message has been leftunchanged, but the supporting text following the KM has been revised to read: ""It is very likely that by mid-century we will see, for the first time in approx. 2 million years, an Arctic Ocean almost entirely free of sea ice atthe end of the annual melt season (i.e. late summer) (Collins et al. 2013; Snape and Forster 2014); as modelshave tended to under-predict recent sea ice loss (e.g. Stroeve et al., 2007) it is possible this will happen beforemid-century."""

To addressthis point, the text has been revised as follows: ""How will global—and even more importantly, regional—climatechange over the next few decades? The actual state of the climate is always a superposition of natural variabilityand anthropogenic climate change. At the decadal scale, the magnitude of these two factors are equivalent(Easterling and Wehner 2009). At longer time scales (about 3 decades for global measures of the climate), theanthropogenic influence dominates (Santer et al 2011). Our ability to predict the climate at the seasonal todecadal scale is limited both by our imperfect ability to model to specifying the initial conditions of the state ofthe ocean and the chaotic nature of the interconnected earth system (Branstator and Teng 2012; Deser et al.,2012b). Further into the future, as the anthropogenic forcing exceeds natural variability, uncertainty in howhuman activities will evolve becomes increasingly important in projecting the magnitude and patterns of futureglobal warming. Natural variability will continue to be a factor, but most of the difference between present andfuture climates will be determined by choices that society makes today and over the next few decades thatdetermine emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, as well as any potential large-scaleinterventions as discussed in CSSR Chapter 14 (DeAngelo et al. 2017). The further out in time we look, thegreater the influence of these human choices on the magnitude of future warming."""

Andif one set the objective to be 1.5 C, then one has to be at zero much sooner. I would also note that 1.5 and 2 C asstabilization levels would have tremendous impacts.

The warming and associated climate effects fromcarbon emissions will persist for decades to millennia (Ciais et al. 2013; Joos et al. 2013). Accounting foremissions of carbon as well as other greenhouse gases and particles with lifetimes from weeks to centuries,cumulative anthropogenic carbon emissions would likely need to stay below about 800 GtC since thepreindustrial era in order to provide a two-thirds likelihood of preventing 3.6°F (2°C) of warming, implying thatapproximately only 230 GtC more could be emitted globally in order to meet that target.""

We strongly advise striking the above sentence as multiplerecent studies have shown that on-site fuel availability for power generation has had virtually no impact oneither resiliency or reliability, with extreme weather events included in the underpinning analyses. For instance,a recent analysis performed by the Rhodium Group  concluded that outages caused by disruptions of fuel supplyto generators appear to be virtually nonexistent. A mere 0.00007% of customer-hours lost to outage werecaused by fuel supply emergencies between 2012-2016, a period when 32% of the country's coal fired powerunits and 6% of its nuclear generating units were retired.

Similarly,in the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine's recent report on ""Enhancing the Resilience ofthe Nation's Electricity System,"" the authors explain the risks associated with many potential hazards to theelectricity system from human actions and from natural causes.

It seems to be a reference to the dual fuel capability to gas-fired units required bygrid operators, particularly in the Northeast. In that case, it would be important to add the geographical context,i.e. that this has been one of the solutions to enhance resiliency in the Northeast, where competing uses of gasfor both heating and power generation have historically led to price spikes during cold snaps. It would also beimportant to add that demand response availability is increasingly recognized as an important resiliencymeasure alongside dual fuel capability. For instance, the New England grid operator runs a ""winter reliabilityprogram"" to boost fuel reserves and demand response availability when the grid is under weather stresses (theprogram was initiated in the wake of the outages prompted by the 2014 polar vortex). We also strongly advisethat the authors of this section mention that the increased used of oil use is not a good long-term solution froman environmental standpoint. Instead, more investments in energy efficiency, smarter use of existing gaspipelines (here's a recent study on how withholding of gas pipeline capacity may be artificially limiting supply inNew England and driving up prices: https://www.edf.org/sites/default/files/vertical-market-power.pdf), andincreased energy storage, demand response and renewable energy are better tools to meet our energy needs,lower peak power demand, and enhance grid resiliency. (Please refer to our comments to the sections on pages171 through 173 of this chapter discussing how demand response in particular helped the grid carry the crisisduring the 2014 polar vortex, and how well wind projects have fared during last week's cold spell that hit much ofthe Northeast region).","The language has been expaned along with the addition of two references: (1) NERC (North American ElectricReliability Corporation) 2013.

For instance, sources like Bloomberg New Energy Financeand others project a significant increase in the adoption of distributed solar resources and storage technologies.In addition, it's important to mention that Northeast states are setting large energy storage targets and makingsignificant investments. Just this week, New York Governor Cuomo announced a plan to install the capability tostore 1,500 megawatts of energy by 2025. We would also recommend emphasizing  the important role thatwind, solar, and demand response play in enhancing grid resiliency during extreme weather events.

Additionally, giventhat wind often generates more power than normal during the rapid-wind spells of extreme weather events, thenation's first offshore wind project- Block Island Wind- operated nearly around the clock in the strong windswhich accompanied the frigid cold that most of the East Coast just experienced.

Several references and DOE diagrams(cartoons) use the nomenclature. Though it is somewhat address on page 176, it can be more explicitly stated.several instances In several places, the text states ""extreme weather and climate change"". This can be mostunhelpful and confusing. Climate change induces more frequent extremes. It would helpful to explain clearlythat ""Weather impacts the operations of energy components, while climate and climate change impacts thedesign of those components"". Explain please that energy is the only commodity that is sold the instant it isproduced. Energy systems operate on a four second refresh cycle. Weather is the primary threat to the safedeliver of energy. Climate, on the other hand, is used for the design of future energy systems. Renewableenergy is inevitable as the next step in the energy evolution. Whereas previous energy infrastructure was ""one-way"" from proccuction to consumption, renewable energy production can be on the ""consumption"" end of theenergy system. Two-way production to consumption is a new design criteria, not only accounting for the need toreduce CO2 emissions, but also accounting for the realities of local distributed production, at the point ofconsumption. Local production becomes more necessary in a changing climate.173 line 15 Good point ""Because energy infrastructure is long lived, decisions about how to locate, expand, andmodify‰Û_will influence for decades to come"".

Thechapter should make clear that (1) these ecological disturbances are natural components of forest ecosystemhealth, and (2) wildfire and insect outbreaks in forests do not appear to be occurring at levels that exceedhistorical levels, nor are they necessarily projected to be.In discussing wildfire in forests, the Chapter should acknowledge that (1) wildfire is a natural and necessary partof US forest ecosystems that is important for forest ecosystem health.Research has increasingly recognized the importance of biodiverse, ecologically significant, and unique‰ÛÏcomplex early seral forest‰Û(also called ‰ÛÏsnag forest habitat‰Û) created by high-severity fire.Hundreds of scientific studies document the high levels of native biodiversity and wildlife abundance in complexearly seral forest created when patches of high-severity fire occur in mature conifer forest (and where thisunique wildlife habitat not been subjected to common post-fire management, such as post-fire logging andartificial tree planting, and herbicide spraying).  Many of the native wildlife species found in complex early seralforest are primarily or almost exclusively found in such habitat, due to the high abundance of snags (standingdead trees) and downed logs and/or the abundance of shrub patches and young natural regeneration of conifersand oaks.

Shaye,Wolf,143667,Whole Page,06. Forests,,223,,,,"In the context of climate change, logging can have detrimental effects on forest ecosystem services such ascarbon storage. This should be acknowledged by the Chapter in the State of the Forest Sector section andAdaptation section.Harvest of live trees from the forest not only reduces current standing carbon stocks, but also reduces theforest‰Ûas future rate of carbon sequestration and its future carbon storage capacity, by removing trees thatotherwise would have continued to grow and remove CO2 from the atmosphere.  Numerous studies indicatethat protection from logging increases forest carbon storage, while thinning forests to reduce fire activitydecreases forest carbon stocks and results in increased carbon emissions to the atmosphere that can persist fordecades.For example, Tan et al. (2015) found that, by 2050, the climate change scenario that most heavily emphasizedprotection of forests from logging (B1) resulted in the highest levels of forest carbon storage and rates of carbonsequestration, while the scenarios that emphasized forest cutting (A1B and A2) reduced the proportionalcontribution of federal forestlands to the nation‰Ûas overall carbon storage levels (see Table 2).  Similarly, astudy by Depro et al.

(2012) concluded that thinning forests to avoid high-severity fire could actually reduce forestcarbon stocks and increase overall carbon emissions.  Because the probability of a fire on any given acre offorest is relatively low, forest managers must treat many more acres than will actually burn, and thinning endsup removing more carbon than would be released in a fire. The researchers estimated that thinning operationstypically tend to remove about three times as much carbon from the forest as would be avoided in wildfireemissions. They cautioned that ‰ÛÏcurrent claims that fuel-reduction treatments function to increase forest Csequestration are based on specific and sometimes unrealistic assumptions regarding treatment efficacy,wildfire emissions, and wildfire burn probability.‰ÛThe study concluded that ‰ÛÏwe found little credibleevidence that such efforts [fuel-reduction treatments] have the added benefit of increasing terrestrial Cstocks‰Ûand ‰ÛÏmore often, treatment would result in a reduction in C stocks over space and time.‰Û",The issue of relevance of logging and thinning has been clarified elsewhere in the chapter.

However, for these mortality statistics to be meaningful,it is critical to place current snag densities into the context of historical levels and within the context ofmanagement objectives. The current amount of complex early seral forests, or ‰ÛÏsnag forest habitat,‰Ûcreated by native bark beetles, drought, and fire is estimated to be lower than natural, historical levels (Swansonet al. 2011, DellaSala et al. 2014) and not in excess of the upper bounds of the natural range of variability inSierra Nevada forests. Historically, at any given point in time, 14% to 30% of conifer forests were comprised ofcomplex early seral forests, including ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests, in the Sierra Nevada (Baker2014, Hanson and Odion 2016).Secondly, the Chapter asserts repeatedly that fire suppression has created overly dense forests that needdensity reduction treatments (see pages 227, 229, 235).

(2009) doesn‰Ûat support this statement, but rather discusses the use ofthe concept of historical range and variability in landscape management.Secondly, the Chapter should acknowledge that there is more complexity when discussing changes in densityand flammabilty. For example, in California, forests are much less dense in terms of basal area than they werehistorically, largely due to past and current logging. Sierra Nevada forests are estimated to be about 30% lessdense, and Tranverse and Peninsular Range forests were 40% less dense, in terms of basal area in the 2000scompared to the 1930s (McIntyre et al. 2015 at Figure 1a).  Moreover, studies indicate that California‰Ûasmixed-conifer and ponderosa pine forests historically had a wide range of densities. For example, areconstruction of historical forest structure in Sierra mixed-conifer forests based on 1865-1885 survey datasuggests that historical forests ""were open and park-like in places, but generally dense, averaging 293trees/ha‰Ûwith smaller pines and oaks numerically dominant, as indicative of mixed- rather than low-severity fire regimes (Baker 2014).  An assessment of US Forest Service forest survey data from 1910 and 1911for central and southern Sierra Nevada ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests similarly indicates thathistorical forests had a high variability in density, again indicative of varied disturbance intensities andfrequencies (Hanson and Odion 2016).Empirical studies have also found that forest areas in California that have missed the largest number of firereturn intervals are not burning at higher fire severity. Specifically, six empirical studies found that the most long-unburned (most fire-suppressed) forests burned mostly at low/moderate-severity, and did not have higherproportions of high-severity fire than less fire-suppressed forests. Forests that were not fire suppressed (e.g.,those that had not missed fire cycles, i.e., Condition Class 1, or ‰ÛÏFire Return Interval Departure‰Ûclass 1)generally had levels of high-severity fire similar to, or higher than, those in the most fire-suppressed forests, asfound by Odion et al. 2004 (Klamath-Siskiyou), Odion and Hanson 2006 (Sierra Nevada), Odion and Hanson2008 (Sierra Nevada), Odion et al. 2010 (Klamath Mountains), Miller et al. 2012 (Sierra Nevada), and vanWagtendonk et al. 2012 (Sierra Nevada).","The citation was corrected to be Keane et al.

Shaye,Wolf,143891,Text Region,06. Forests,,235,235,22,26,"The Chapter‰Ûas claim that stand density management and surface fuel reduction will increase forestresilience to increased temperature, drought and disturbance is not supported by the scientific literature or thereferences cited.At 235 the Chapter states: ‰ÛÏmany ongoing practices that address existing forest managementneeds‰ÛÓstand density management, surface fuel reduction, and control of invasive species‰ÛÓare alsoconsidered climate-smart because they reduce risk by creating resilience to increased temperature, drought, anddisturbance.‰Û‰ÛÏFor example, forest managers are considering greater reductions in stand density toincrease forest resistance and resilience to fire, insects, and drought.‰ÛFigure 6.5 also states that adaptationoptions for ‰ÛÏincreasing drought severity and incidence of insect outbreaks‰Ûinclude ‰ÛÏreduce foreststand density to increase tree vigor.‰ÛHowever, the state of the science on this issue is more complex. Current research suggests that forestmanagement treatments focused on thinning trees to increase resilience can be counter-productive, and manystudies recommend restoring natural disturbance processes to increase resilience.Studies indicate that increased density does not necessarily equate to a lack of resilience, as measured by treemortality and physiological stress levels. In the mixed conifer forests of California‰Ûas Lake Tahoe Basin, arecent study found ‰ÛÏa nuanced relationship between stocking level [density], forest mortality and droughteffects‰Û(Van Gunst et al. 2016).  In mid- to upper-elevation forests, increased density was associated withdecreased probability of mortality, especially during wetter periods, whereas increased density was moreassociated with increased probability of mortality in lower elevation forests and drier climate periods. Theresearchers suggested that ‰ÛÏno single density-reduction forest management strategy will increase forestresilience under all climate periods and in all forest types.‰ÛA study in the Douglas fir forests of northeastern Washington found that competition [i.e., higher density] didnot affect tree responses to extreme drought (Carnwath and Nelson 2016).  Importantly, trees with morecompetition from neighbors appeared to have higher drought resistance (i.e., a significantly higher proportion ofsapwood area in latewood, which is a trait associated with drought resistance). The authors suggested that‰ÛÏa tree‰Ûas ability to cope with environmental variability is driven not just by the proximate effects ofneighbours on resource availability, but also by phenotypic plasticity and long-term adaptations to competitive","We respectfully disagree with the reviewer's comment on this issue. Our inferences are based on hundreds ofpublications in the scientific literature, based on both empirical data and modeling, that demonstrate theeffectiveness of stand density management, only a few of which are cited here. The scientific literature onclimate change adaptation reinforces the value of stand density management. No change was made."

There is no mention of defensible space anywhere in the chapter, whichshould also be fixed.The chapter promotes fuel reduction as climate change adaptation measures. However, recent studies highlightthe limitations of fuel reduction approaches in altering fire behavior, particularly because (a) fuel treatments arelargely ineffective under extreme fire weather conditions that create the largest fires and the vast majority ofannual area burned, (b) there is a low probability that areas receiving fuels treatment will overlap with wildfires,and (c) fuel treatments are costly and often infeasible to implement widely.As summarized by DellaSala et al. (2017): ‰ÛÏOn public lands, current fire policy promotes thinning over largelandscapes (e.g., USDA Forest Service 2002, US Congress 2003, USDA Forest Service 2009, US Congress 2015),which is costly (Schoennagel and Nelson 2011), infeasible over large areas (Calkin et al. 2013, North et al. 2015a,Parks et al. 2015), and largely ineffective under extreme fire weather conditions (Lydersen et al. 2014, Cary etal. 2016).‰ÛSimilarly, Zachmann et al.

On models in general, it states: “Confidencein the usefulness of the future projections generated by global climate models is based on multiple factors.These include the fundamental nature of the physical processes they represent, such as radiative transfer orgeophysical fluid dynamics, which can be tested directly against measurements or theoretical calculations todemonstrate that model approximations are valid. They also include the vast body of literature dedicated toevaluating and assessing model abilities to simulate observed features of the earth system, including large scalemodes of natural variability; and to reproduce their net response to external forcing that captures the interactionof many processes which produce observable climate system feedbacks (e.g., Flato et al. 2013).” (Chapter 4)Regarding the specific performance of global climate models in reproducing observed trends, on extremeprecipitation, for example, Vol. 1 concludes: “The frequency and intensity of extreme heat and heavyprecipitation events are increasing in most continental regions of the world (very high confidence). These trendsare consistent with expected physical responses to a warming climate. Climate model studies are also consistentwith these trends, although models tend to underestimate the observed trends, especially for the increase inextreme precipitation events (very high confidence for temperature, high confidence for extreme precipitation).”"

An example is the Florida Keys, an area where natural communities already are greatly reduced andfragmented due to human development. Many species and subspecies of plants and animals there already areat high risk of extinction (and listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act, for thatreason). Effects of climate change, including sea level rise and associated storm surge, already are impactingmuch the remaining natural habitat and freshwater aquifers, and these impacts are particularly great withextreme events, e.g., hurricanes that are of greater intensity as a result of changing climate. Regardless of theclimate change scenario used, the projections are for increasing sea level and storm surge over time, and giventhat sea level rise will continue for centuries, this is significant.

Allison,Crimmins,142153,Text Region,08. Coastal Effects,,310,310,10,35,"This text is ok, but a little overly general. It seems to just say adaptation is needed, but it's hard, and somewherethere are some examples. What sort of adaptation is needed? How would it help protect against coastalimpacts? What benefit would be see? How much would it cost? It would also be really interesting to note, if youcan find literature on this, how frustrating it can be to talk about adaptation on the coasts, because even whenadaptation or abandonment is the ""right"" decision to make economically, most people refuse to abandon theirproperty (not to mention federal money keeps bailing them out, so why move?). This makes trying to projectfuture damages to coastal property really challenging, because you'd think you could just make a rule in themodel that when it is cheaper to abandon than adapt, people choose to abandon. But of course, no such rationalactors. There is this odd psyche of people unwilling to ""be beaten"" by nature and they'll ""be survivors"" and justkeep rebuilding, even when it makes no sense to do so.  These types of topics could replace things like page 310lines 17-22, which is already covered in the regional rollup. Even lines 10-15 is already covered elsewhere in thechapter.","Thank you for your comments. The National Climate Assessment is a scientific document that provides a basisfor decision making, but does not prescribe policy or specific adaptation measures. Discussion of these topics isbeyond the scope of the assessment. The wide range of costs, adaptation types, and communities affectedmake it impossible to go into detail in a chapter such as this one. You will find greater detail about particularprojects in the regional chapters. The coastal effects chapter looks more at the broad trends that are facing all ofthe coastal regions."

(1) The lack of significant difference in the dollar amounts associated with thetwo adaptation scenarios is a result of the scale of the dollars. Because the original report rounds to only onedecimal point, it would take a change of $100 billion to show a change. Because the authors do not have accessto the full dollar amounts, the language has been amended for clarity. (2) It is true that some data exists (basedon observations) regarding the value of properties damaged and abandoned, but the data is patchy along theentire coastline of the CONUS, and very inconsistent in quality and content.  It was determined to be a hugeundertaking to rectify these differences (assuming the data even exists in enough places), and in light of that, theauthors used a model to represent this 2000-2017 time period.  Further the model works deterministically, thusreal and modeled damage can differ at fine spatial and temporal scales. (3) The step-wise nature of the graph isdue to the fact that the analysis evaluates storm surge risks every ten years, beginning in 2005."

As pointed out in thechapter, these large areas are extremely important to the U.S.  The chapter logically presents pertinentinformation.  A few comments to consider:Consider revising or replacing the present figures.  The figures do not add much, particularly figures 9.1 and 9.3.In addition, figure 9.3 currently appears twice in the chapter.Coral bleaching is mentioned in the Ocean Ecosystems section (p. 336, centered on line 13).  I believe bleachingfits better in the Extreme Events section.Add a statement early in the Extreme Events section that emphasizes that it is often extreme events, on top oflonger term change, that have major impacts on species and ecosystems.  E.g. it‰Ûas the duration and extentof a heat wave, a cold snap, an OA event, a hypoxic event, . . . that often has the greatest impact and these canbe more extreme due to a changing baseline due to climate change.  This idea is already in this section, but is notclearly brought out.","We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments. For the figures, we are replacing Figure 1 based on othercomments we received and we are adding the 2015/16 bleaching event to Figure 3. Note the reason Figure 3appears twice is that we were asked to select a figure for inclusion with our summary.  This will be publishedseparately when the entire NCA is produced.  As for bleaching, this is challenging because it is both a trend andan event (as discussed in Hughes et al. 2018). We elected to keep it in KM1 as bleaching is one of the mostobvious ""ecosystem disruptions"" in the ocean.  However, we have included the 2015/16 mass bleaching underKM3. We appreciate the suggestion to emphasize the connection between short-term cycles and long-termglobal trends in the formation of extreme events. We currently mention this in the introduction to KM3, in the""projected impacts"" and ""emerging issues"" sections and in the traceable accounts.

Oceans and MarineResources",,,,,,"The following comments are submitted on behalf of the Marine Fisheries Advisory Committee (MAFAC), aNOAA federal advisory committee:‰Û¢        The authors of the NCA4 Oceans and Marine Resource Chapter did an excellent job providing anupdate on the impacts and risks of carbon emissions to marine ecosystems and resources in the U.S.  This is arapidly developing field and the authors captured key events and findings in a very succinct manner, using abroad range of regional examples.  In addition, they offered important insights and optimism for our potential toadapt to the changes, as well as increase the resilience of marine ecosystems.  The draft was well written for ageneral audience and the figures very much enhanced the communication of key points to a broad audience.The following points raised in the draft of Chapter 9, Oceans and Marine Resources are particularly important toretain:‰Û¢        We are living with the impacts of climate change now (e.g., extreme weather events such 100 yearfloods, intense hurricanes, and marine heat waves as well as long-term shifts in fish population‰Ûas distributionand productivity). Intensity and frequency of events is increasing. (example: Key Messages, p. 331; p. 332, lines14-20; figure 9.3.)‰Û¢        The focus on the trifecta of changes occurring in the oceans: warming, acidification, and deoxygenationis important. The cumulative impacts of these changes and their interactions will determine what species thrivein their current locations, where they may exist in the future, and which will decline or cease to exist in the future.(examples: Key Message 2, p.331 and 338-341.)‰Û¢        The fact that the oceans play a pivotal role in the global climate system is important to emphasize.The oceans have received relatively little attention in past climate assessments (both national andinternational); it is important to recognize their importance to the central issue of climate change and potentialfeedbacks. (example: Overview, p. 334, lines 11-15.)‰Û¢        The importance of identifying and continuing assessments on the most vulnerable marine ecosystems(e.g., tropical, polar, and island ecosystems in the U.S. and U.S. Territories). (examples: p. 338, lines 14-17; p.349, lines 6-9.)‰Û¢        The importance of fostering resilience in our marine ecosystems and resources by taking specificactions.

It also provides adetailed account of changes in the socio-economic aspects of the country, especially the people who are livingnear the coastal regions. Oceanic acidification and deoxygenation are explained in detail and gives clearevidence of imbalances in the marine life in future.2) The three key messages given in the chapter are very critical not only to the marine organisms, but also canprove fatal to the economical infrastructure of the nation. Since a big amount of population is dependent heavilyon the fishing zones, any changes in the oceanic waters will lead to a disruption in these zones and therefore willaffect the livelihood of people. It can also lead to inflation in the market prices of seafood, thus leading toincrease in the net expense of the people.3) The only limiting factor which may be improved in the future studies is to use an ensemble of coupled earthsystem model so as to include feedbacks due to biogeochemical cycles, sea-ice, phytoplankton etc on theclimate system.

The increasing evaporation ismitigating all the ocean rise due to glacier melt.  This increase is also responsible for increased weather andstorm clouds.

Thereare some places of redundancy where whole paragraphs can be cut (noted in other comments). This chapterwould also benefit from fewer sub-headings. I would suggest not separating out observed sections fromprojected sections. Opportunities for reducing risk is good, but I wonder if the mitigation ones can be combinedand go under Key Message 1 and the adaptation ones under Key Message 2, so you don't need separatesections under each key message. The climate-ready fishery management section on the top of page 341would make a nice text box. The emerging issues text can all be punted to the traceable accounts. That couldhelp you consolidate the sections under just the overview and three key messages. You also don't need aconclusion, like a journal article. These can just end when the information is done. Also, all three of your figuresare maps, which is a little map heavy. But I wonder if you could save space by having a 3-paneled set of maps inone figure. Or by overlaying the marine heatwaves on top of the projected ocean temperatures in figure 9.1.

The following information should be included to acknowledge current / ongoing effectsof climate change on shellfish and aquaculture, rather than just projected or expected impacts (using referencesalready cited in this chapter):Ocean acidification has already cost the US Pacific Northwest oyster industry approximately $110 million, puttingin jeopardy nearly 3,200 jobs (Ekstrom et al 2015).Upwelling waters with elevated PCO2 (hypothesized as a recurring feature of a warming climate) were linked toseveral years of oyster seed production failures in a hatchery in the US Pacific Northwest which used commoncommercial hatchery conditions and protocols (Barton et al. 2015)While this information does not immediately appear to fit in to any specific areas text areas, it seems as thoughmarine aquaculture generally would be best referenced as a part of the ‰ÛÏmarine fisheries‰ÛKeyMessage, which could be expanded to be more inclusive of other forms of marine resources under existingthreat from climate change that does not result solely from extreme events.References:","Thank you for your ample comments.  Please note that ocean acidification impacts in the Northwest werecovered in NCA3.  Given our page limit for this chapter, we relied on the Northwest Chapter to cover the story ofthe impacts of OA on shellfish more in depth.

Oceans and MarineResources",,335,338,29,17,"This comment was prepared after discussions by subgroups of the University of Washington Program on ClimateChange and the Public Comment Project in Seattle, WA. Among those who participated in discussions, thefollowing wished to be named: Mary Fisher, Megan Feddern, Dr. Michelle Tigchelaar, Dr. Cecilia Bitz, Dr. RichardGammon.This comment is in support of the first Key Message of Chapter 9, ‰ÛÏOcean Ecosystems.‰ÛTwo qualities,which we believe to be critically important to the discussion of this subject, distinguish this Key Message fromthe remaining two Key Messages in Chapter 9, as well as across other NCA4 chapters.First, the sole focus of this Key Message is on marine ecosystem changes, regardless of related human impacts.This is particularly important information to review, as it generates a fuller understanding of the challengesfacing ocean ecosystems as well as the more human-centric climate change impacts addressed in KeyMessages 2 & 3. Before we can fully understand the climate impacts on human populations that result fromchanges in marine resources and extreme events, it must first be made clear the impacts of ocean warming,ocean acidification, and hypoxia on marine ecosystem structure and function. This Key Message also provides afoundation for future National Climate Assessments, as many of the impacts on marine ecosystems that arecurrently being observed or projected have indirect, or as yet unclear, impacts on human populations.Secondly, this Key Message specifically calls out ‰ÛÏsignificant reductions in carbon emissions‰Ûas the onlyway to avoid ‰ÛÏtransformative impacts on ocean ecosystems.‰ÛThis is a necessary acknowledgementthat while adaptation strategies can mitigate the effects of ocean change on human populations, only reducingcarbon emissions can address the actual drivers of ocean change. To strengthen this statement in the KeyMessage itself, as it may get some pushback farther along in the review process, the authors could include thereferences on page 338; lines 6-7.","We greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comment and support of this key message.  We are pleased that ourthinking is mirrored by that of our reviewers.  We have guidance from USGCRP to refrain from includingreferences in the key messages so will not include the suggested references in the key message text."

Sally,Courtright,141630,"WholeChapter","10. Agriculture andRural Communities",,,,,,"While agriculture is an essential form of revenue to rural communities, in a changing climate, major changes willbe required to how the agricultural system works. The large animal agriculture operations (CAFOs) are a majorsource of greenhouses emissions and result in poor air quality for residents in the surrounding neighborhoods.There are clear gradients of particulate matter in the air surrounding CAFOs, and the resulting air quality resultsin an increased incidence of respiratory diseases in the nearby residents. The water, carbon, and pollution-intensive nature of these operations means that we must scale them back in the midst of a warmer climate withmore variable precipitation.The way that traditional agriculture uses soil also needs to change. Modern agricultural techniques result inthe soil being able to store significantly less carbon than it used to; changing farming practices can make oursoils become a source, rather than a sink, for carbon. The production of fertilizers is also a source of emissionsthat cannot be ignored when addressing agriculture, and their overuse threatens many areas of environmentalquality. It is inevitable that prices in food will go up as we exchange the extremely efficient but unsustainabletechniques of the green revolution for sound practices that preserve soil and water quality. However, with theright government programs in place, it is possible for Americans to adapt to a change in how we produce food,and to produce food in a way that promotes environmental health in all areas of the country.","Thank you for this comment.  GHG emissions have been increasingly addressed through nutrient managementprogram incentives.  Similarly, conservation tillage management, residue management as well other practicesare gaining widespread use and incentive programs have been in place to encourage these changes.  Manyproducers use computer-assisted precision agriculture and fertilizer application both of which reduce particulateair emissions and reduce the amount of fertilizer used.   Some of the latest advances are in Climate SmartAgriculture where producers learn to reorient practices to a changing climate."

It's impossible to know how high sea levels will rise without knowing how high governments are going toallow emissions to rise.

In similarsituations, it is usually the case that a realistic ""worst case"" scenario be determined that can serve as the basisfor a design standard. However, this is not the approach taken for flood risk, even when determining flood risksbased on past data. FEMA, in assembling flood maps and mapping the so-called 100-year flood or the flood witha 1% chance of occurring in any given year, uses the 50th percentile of flood probability when defining thatflood. This results in people having an artificially low perception of flood risks. In reality, there is a 50/50 chancewe have correctly estimated the 100-year floodplain.

The statement seemsto be based on one study in the Eastern U.S. (and only 91 counties) that looked only at ozone, and that usedinterpolation to county centroids to estimate exposure.  In non-urban counties, there are fewer ozone monitors,so the exposure measures are more likely to have additional error relative to urban counties, makingcomparisons between urban and non-urban counties suspect, and in fact the CIs for the urban and non-urbanrisk estimates overlap.

For consistency, the potential for adaptation to reduce air quality related risks should be discussed, alongwith the potential costs and impacts of such adaptation measures.

Jun,Zhang,143604,"WholeChapter",13. Air Quality,,,,,,"This chapter is generally well-structured. It has discussed 4 different aspects of climate change impact on airquality in United States which includes: Increasing Health Risks from Air Pollution;         Increased Impacts ofWildfires; Increases in Airborne Allergen Exposure; Air Quality Benefits of Reduced Emissions. However, thosefour aspects are based on local emissions and changes. The long-range transport from other countries andcontinents is not taken into account. Climate change is projected to alter the general circulation in the future,which could promote air mass exchange with other counties. This could further influence the air quality in theUnited States. It would be better if one more section is added to focus on the long-range transport from otherregions.","For ozone, the authors agree that long-range transport of ozone and its precursors influences US ozone airquality. We address this point by stating: ""Besides being affected by climate change, future ozone levels in theUnited States will also be affected greatly by domestic emissions of ozone precursors, as well as by internationalemissions of ozone precursors and global methane levels."" We have also added the following sentence tohighlight the influence of long-range transport on ozone: ""Additionally, ozone concentrations in one region maybe influenced by the transport of either precursors or ozone itself from another region (Fiore et al., 2009;TFHTAP, 2010)"".  Global multi-model studies suggest that the impact of climate change on long-range transportof ozone is predominantly via changes in emissions and chemistry (e.g, temperature, H2O) rather than climate-related changes in transport (Doherty et al., 2013).

John,Fleming,143637,"WholeChapter",13. Air Quality,,,,,,"In the ""Air Quality"" chapter, the co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions are discussed. These co-benefits include slowing of the progression of global warming and reducing the risks to human health from airpollution. These benefits occur together because, as discussed in the chapter, many constituents emitted withgreenhouse gases contribute to ozone and particulate matter formation, so reducing greenhouse gas emissionsreduces these as well. However, there is a manner in which co-benefits could manifest that has not beendiscussed.Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are primarily discussed in the chapter only in terms of their contribution tothe formation of ozone, where ozone is a significant air pollutant. However, this discounts the role of VOCs as airpollutants themselves. For instance, benzene is a known human carcinogen, while the other BTEX compounds(toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene) have varying effects, including damage to the brain and nervous system,kidneys, and liver. Symptoms of exposure include fatigue, drowsiness, headaches, dizziness, confusion, eye andrespiratory tract irritation, and loss of muscle coordination (Leusch, F., & Bartkow, M., A short primer on benzene,toluene, ethylbenzene and xylenes in the environment and in hydraulic fracturing fluids, 189 Smart Water ResCentre 1 (2010)). Other hazardous air pollutants such as naphthalene, formaldehyde, and 1,3-butadiene are allclassified as carcinogens or potential carcinogens, likewise affecting the respiratory, reproductive, andcardiovascular systems (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, November 4, ATSDR A-Z Index(2015)). Such VOCs are directly associated with emissions from refineries and often present in oil fieldoperations, and in addition to contributing to ozone, pose direct health risks in surrounding areas.The co-benefits from shutting down fossil fuel infrastructure such as refineries would be halting greenhouse gasemissions, limiting the formation of ozone and PM, and preventing the spread of harmful VOCs into surroundingcommunities. Several studies have linked poor health outcomes to proximity to refineries. A 2013 study inGeorgia found that non-Hodgkin lymphoma incidence was significantly higher the closer people lived to benzenerelease sites such as refineries (Bulka, C. et al., Residence proximity to benzene release sites is associated withincreased incidence of non‰ÛHodgkin lymphoma, 119 Cancer 3309 (2013)). A 2014 study of a 2010 flaringincident at a BP refinery in Texas City, Texas found that individuals exposed to resulting emissions were at higherrisk of developing liver and blood-related disorders (D‰ÛaAndrea, M. A., & Reddy, G. K, Hematological andhepatic alterations in nonsmoking residents exposed to benzene following a flaring incident at the British","The text has been modified to incorporate this suggestion.

First, it talks about hospitals, but nowherein the text of the summary is there mention of hospitals. So why is the figure on hospitals here? Second, it isfrom an old source, well before NCA3 came out and of course before the USGCRP health report. This isn'tnecessarily bad on it's own but it certainly doesn't convey that there is any new information or literature that hascome out in the last five years. But of course there has been more recent literature that has come out- there wasa presentation at this year's APHA meeting looking at hospitals across the country in the flood plain. This figurealso does not incorporate FEMA's 2016 proposal to rewrite the 100 year floodplain standard. There is also, ofcourse, all the post-Sandy literature, some of it specific to New York(http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/wef/wefproc/2014/00002014/00000011...or https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/prehospital-and-disaster-medicin...).

Hopefully this is not the case, but it doesn't presentwell. Thirdly, this figure does not convey any sense of urgency. The figure shows that there are many manymore hospitals in New York that are not in the floodplain and are totally fine. Is it the author's intent to tell us notto worry about hospitals in the floodplain? Furthermore, the few hospitals that have tiny little red dots areprimarily in wealthy parts of the city, which seems to go against your Key Message #1.

The second sentence of this paragraph is mentioned in the previous paragraph(Indigenous people) and is also stated in the Tribal chapter. Such general statements do not need to berepeated, but the reader would benefit from more specific information. This is such an important topic, and a keyelement to the Key Message #1, it would be nice to see specific findings on it rather than just general ""thesepopulations are vulnerable"" statements, which were made in the 2016 report. It may help to add vulnerablepopulation considerations into the numerous text boxes in this chapter. In future NCAs, a separate chapter onsocial inequities would be beneficial. But in the meantime, it would help readers if the authors of this chapter toldus the findings of the citations in lines 33 through line 4 on page 525. What are the new findings?

Human Health,,523,525,1,4,"I realise there is a lot of information to cover in this section, but it is five pages long in a chapter meant to be sixpages total. The adaptation section is 3.5 pages and the economic section is 2 pages long. It seems that each ofthese three findings need to be closer to 2 pages apiece to hit 6 pages total (assuming there will be no regionalroundup), and so require some difficult cutting. The text under this Key Message #1 is very redundant-- both tothe 2016 report and to itself.  Much of the information that was presented as ""new"" since the 2016 report wasnot, in fact, new but just another reiteration of the points found in the 2016 report. Many of the ""recent researchshows that..."" statements were using citations that were published before the 2016 report, and did not in factshow that some new piece of scientific knowledge had been achieved. Yet, there are many new papers thathave been published since 2016 that the authors unfortunately did not find or assess. See suggested examplesof sources in previous comments.There are a few options for shortening this section, though I realise each would be painful. First, the authorscould remove all the information that was in the 2016 report and only report actual new findings since thatpublication- only updates, or where the science has advanced. In this option, rather than making generalstatements about climate change impacting, say water or vectorbourne disease, there would be room to presentspecific findings from the author's literature review. Another option would be to create a large figure with the2016 information. One example may be the table at the beginning of the 2016 report with findings from eachchapter. An additional column could be added to note recent research or updates. This could get cumbersome,but it would at least serve as a quick reference guide to the findings of the 2016 report. Or, a table could becreated with the link to the appropriate chapter in the 2016 report and only information about new sciencedisplayed. Another overall option for shortening, one that may have to be taken even if one of the earlieroptions is employed, is to delete one of the text boxes. Both boxes are well-written and helpful, but there justdoesn't seem to be room. Another option would be to drastically shorten or cut the adaptation section. There isalready an adaptation chapter, so much of that information could be placed there, if it is not there already.Regardless, the Key Message #2 section would need to be shortened by nearly half anyway. That section couldbe cut to only a comprehensive 1-page text box that discusses impacts, adaptation, and social inequities, leavingmore room for the text boxes under Key Message #1. The portions of Key Message #2 section that don't have todo with climate change (e.g. early warning system/ response/ predictions) should be cut from a climate",The chapter was extensively edited to shorten and clarify the content.

In light of the evidence in these peer-reviewed publications, you might alsoconsider stating directly that heavy rainfall, flooding and high temperatures have been linked to increases inenteric disease.Publication 1. My research group published a systematic review of the literature on the relationship betweendiarrheal diseases and four meteorological conditions that are expected to increase with climate change:ambient temperature, heavy rainfall, drought, and flooding (Levy et al. 2016). We reviewed 141 articles,evaluated the weight of the evidence, potential sources of bias, and the biological plausibility of observedassociations. The key areas of agreement include 1) a positive association between ambient temperature anddiarrheal diseases, with the exception of viral diarrhea, and 2) an increase in diarrheal disease following heavyrainfall and flooding events. Insufficient evidence was available to evaluate the effects of drought on diarrhea.These associations were observed in low-, middle- and high-income countries, including the United States. Wefound considerable evidence from the literature describing biophysical and behavioral explanatory mechanismsto support the biological plausibility of the above climate-diarrhea associations.Publication 2. We additionally conducted a meta-analysis of the subset of 26 manuscripts from our systematicreview that provided quantitative estimates of the association between temperature and diarrheal diseases(Carlton et al. 2016). This analysis showed the relationship between temperature and diarrhea varies bypathogen taxa. We found a positive association between ambient temperature and all-cause diarrhea(incidence rate ratio (IRR) 1.07; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03, 1.10) and bacterial diarrhea (IRR 1.07; 95% CI1.04, 1.10), but not viral diarrhea (IRR 0.96; 95% CI 0.82, 1.11).In light of the above, you might consider stating directly that heavy rainfall, flooding and high temperatureshave been linked to increases in enteric disease. Alternatively, you could add the citations described above, tothose listed on p. 523, lines 18 & 19.ReferencesCarlton EJ, Woster AP, DeWitt P, Goldstein RS, Levy K.

Michael,MacCracken,144400,"WholeChapter",14. Human Health,,,,,,"Mitchell Knoor- Environmental ChemistryI chose to study chapter 14 on human healthComment 1KM2- The first part of KM2 talks about how to implement policies that prepare for climate change risks. Thesepolicies are aimed at reducing the number of climate-change-related injuries and sicknesses. The second part ofKM2 talks about how to explicitly add climate change risks into the building of infrastructure in the future.Although both parts of KM2 are important for the future, these two topics do not really seem very related. Thefirst part seems to be focusing more on legislation and political change while the second part seems to befocusing more on building design. It doesn‰Ûat really make a lot of sense to have these two together in thesame key message since they don‰Ûat appear to be related. Combining them could potentially make it soneither part is effectively implemented. So my question is: Why are both of these ideas in the same keymessage and not separate key messages?Comment 2Infrastructure planning as it relates to climate change seems to be mostly focused on the distant future. Verylittle talk is focused on how to make changes to existing buildings. Page 525 line 35 discuses how to makechanges to infrastructure from climate change projections ‰ÛÏover a scale of several decades.‰ÛClimatechange will certainly be a problem in the future, but it is also a problem now. It seems like there is a need toquickly make changes to buildings already in existence. The effects of climate change are seen in the present aswell and plans should be put in place to make current buildings more sturdy. The lack of discussion on changes inthe near future seems to be an omission that could negatively impact others. So my question is: Why is therelittle emphasis on short term fixes to current infrastructure in order to make it more climate-change resistant?Comment threePage 528 (line 19)-pg 529 (line 5) discusses the benefits of hospitals themselves reducing greenhouse gasemissions and being more energy-efficient. Obviously, this is a very important endeavor to pursue. Wastefulenergy use and emissions harmful to the environment should be reduced as much as possible. However,potential drawbacks and how to accomplish this in a safe and effective manner is not mentioned in this section.Changing how energy is used in a hospital will likely not be perfectly seamless. Malfunctions could possibly","The first sentence in this key message states ""Individuals, communities, public health departments, healthcarefacilities, organizations, and others are taking action to reduce health vulnerability to current climate change andto increase resilience to the risks projected in coming decades"" to make clear that adaptation is needed fromindividual to infrastructure.

Is it do to a lack of a safety net or insurance?  Is it because of reduced availability of money for otherhealth care needs?  Does this hold true regardless of income levels or housing price?  This is important becausepolicies should be directed at the underlying causes.

Regarding the second component on challenges with respect to resettlement planning andimplementation, the authors have added text to the Displacement and Relocation section of Key Message 3 thatdiscusses such challenges, which include the lack of a comprehensive federal program to assist tribes withrelocation and the lack of models on how to maintain community and cultural continuity in the face of relocation.Regarding the third component of the comment on broad solutions, while these suggestions are valuable indiscussing solutions, the authors were instructed not to be policy prescriptive because the NCA4 is a state-of-the-science assessment and not a policy document.

Tribal andIndigenousCommunities",,548,548,34,37,"So, having been the liaison from the National Assessment team to the Native Peoples for the first NationalAssessment, we heard this statement about having a long history of adapting to climate variability, and so weasked them how they did this, and what became clear was that their primary adaptation strategy was to moveto where the resources were, where food species had moved, where water was more abundant--summarizedmost simply as 'to follow the buffalo.' As various of the Indigenous participants in our effort were proudly sayingthis, one could see the realization in their eyes that this primary strategy is no longer available to them due totheir communities being now on reservations, so that they are really unable to just relocate to wherever theresources would now be. That this is the case seems to me to be far too obscure in the lines of text in the chapter--""dynamical relations to the natural environment"" does not clearly indicate that what is presumably meantinvolved substantial relocation, and ""barriers to adaptation"" does not really convey the problem of beingrestricted to reservations (as a tribal group as opposed to individuals being able to relocate, but outside theircultural and linguistic home). So, I think this paragraph needs to be rewritten to more clearly explain the""unique"" aspect of their situation as a result of the impossibility now of simply moving across the Americanlandscape to meet historic needs. Yes, through treaties there are situations where they could access public landsto harvest various types of traditional flora and fauna that are shifting, but this is difficult to arrange and canraise animosities among those not allowed to take such harvests (e.g., collecting feathers, plants, salmon, etc.).There is the whole treaty system (an area of law said to be more complex that US tax law) that applies andintroduces all sorts of privileges and complications, some being contested by various parties. I just don't thinkthe uniqueness aspect really comes across very well.","The Executive Summary has been heavily edited and no longer contains this exact language from the PublicReview Draft.

It isalso difficult for knowledgeable readers to know if you mean long-term change in climate variability (climatechange leading to more variance) or just plain ""extreme weather"".

We think our analysis is strengthened by including extreme events whether or not theyhave been completely or partially attributed to anthropogenic climate change.

We contend that even without attribution,such events are useful to include because these types of events are projected to become more frequent andsevere with climate change.We are intentionally not indicating that all of the changes have harmful impacts tothe U.S. economy and trade since some can be negative and some can be positive.

I realize the icons in the map are examples,but they are oddly sparse. If you were only providing one example for each type, that would make more sense.But, for instance, there are two examples of instability (I'm guessing from the symbol this has something to dowith water?) and those are in Ethiopia and Russia, to my best estimate. Why? Why those examples, why notothers? It is also really hard to tell where some of these icons are placed- is the demand for humanitarian aidicon in Somalia? Vietnam? Taiwan? Then some icons are more specific than others- why is just coffee singledout? Why is just electronics singled out in the World Bank icon? Why is the shipping route icon east of Greenlandand not north of Alaska?I'm not convinced this is the most compelling figure for this chapter, and I'm not convinced that a map is useful.Showing that there are impacts all over the world doesn't seem like the main message this chapter is trying toconvey. A figure that focuses on just one or two Key Messages may be better.  For example, if there was a wayto show where military troops are deployed and overlay that with maps of extreme weather impacts or naturaldisasters or maybe economic impacts, etc. that may more directly relate to the key messages. For the currentfigure, if these are 8 examples of the types of impacts this chapter covers, maybe just a table with the 8 topicsand a sentence or two explaining these examples would be more helpful than dropping icons on a map withoutdetails. If the authors would like to keep the map, I would suggest using just one example for each icon andfinding a way to include a sentence that explains that example. For example, an interactive map would allow apop-up box next to each icon that explains- in one sentence- what the coffee production issue in (Chile? Peru?) isand how that affects the US. There are a lot of good citations in this figure caption, but it makes me curious whatthe results of those studies are.

However, to justify the useof technological and human assets to investigate an emerging area of concern outside of known areas ofenvironmental degradation, famine, political deterioration, and conflict several obstacles need to be overcome.Such obstacles include: differing taxonomies, languages, and acronyms; overly restricted information access;and cultural reservations and perceptions.-While thereâ€TMs support that favors a correlation between food insecurity as a driver for political instability thatresults in conflict, conflating causality and correlation is not likely to net defense and security support on thescale and scope it is actually needed.

George,Backus,141845,"WholeChapter",17. Complex Systems,,,,,,"The use of complex-systems concept is interesting and appropriate to note in the chapter, but it not useful to thegeneral reader. The most salient and insightful element for readers is how the chapters tie together the topics(regional and sector) of the other chapters.  It enables readers to understand the interdependencies, say among,water, agriculture, forests, human health, energy production, as well as to understand spillover impacts to/fromother regions that are critical to climate change adaptation planning.  Focusing on one aspect in isolation couldlead to significant counterproductive outcomes.  Within the other chapters and even this chapter, the use of theword ‰ÛÏcomplex‰Ûoften implies ‰Û÷complicated‰Ûor more precisely the complications associatedwith managing highly-interconnected systems undergoing multiple stressors.    Therefore, to emphasize theimportance to the reader rather than the expansiveness of the science, I think the chapter would be better titled:‰ÛÏSectoral interdependencies, Multiple stressors, and Highly-Interconnected Systems.‰ÛFurther, the useof the words ‰ÛÏComplex Systems‰Ûto denote this chapter in other chapters should be changed to simply‰ÛÏCh. 17: Interdependencies.‰ÛBecause this chapter does employ both the formal mathematical use ofthe term ‰ÛÏcomplex systems, and the informal ‰ÛÏcomplicated systems‰Ûusage, I think precise languageusage is needed, for example, use ‰ÛÏcomplicated,‰Û‰ÛÏintertwined,‰Û‰ÛÏinterlinked,‰Û‰ÛÏcoupled,‰Ûetc. when noting many parts connected in an intricate way, and save the term‰ÛÏcomplex‰Ûfor only the discussion related to emergent-behavior or self-organization.This chapter could be the most useful one for non-scientist readers.  It furnishes the cross-disciplinaryperspective for tying the seemingly disparate chapter topics and concepts into an integrated, comprehensiblewhole that can be utilized for decision-making.","This comment makes a good point about the vernacular use of “complexity” and “interdependence,” which theauthors have discussed. We decided to reserve “interdependence” for specific cases, and use “interacting” and“interaction” for the broader meaning. In my view, complexity remains a central theme to the chapter becausethe interactions among these systems make their behaviors hard to predict. We agree with the reviewer'scomment about the accessibility of the notion of complex systems science and the way in which this moreprecise use of the word ""complex"" might confuse readers. We have moved the discussion of complex systemsscience to Key Message #1 where it more clearly fits within the flow of the logic of the chapter."

These interacting influences are important to recognize whenconsidering mitigation or adaptation interventions.

If the directed arcs (paths) can be traced around a set of elements andreturn to the same place, there is a feedback relationship.

Soren,Warland,141629,"WholeChapter",18. Northeast,,,,,,"Another issue to consider in the northeast is migration from other places in the country to this area. As theclimate in the southern and western regions of the US becomes hotter and less tolerable to people, some willmove to the northeast in order to live in a cooler climate. The northeast, especially northern states such asMaine, can expect to see an influx of people in the coming decades. The chapter mentioned outflows of peoplefrom the coast, but did not consider that a warming climate may cause more people to move into the states.Mentioning the contamination of water and soil through increased heavy precipitation events and stormsurge is a good point for spurring a local civil government to take action on updating infrastructure to deal with achanging climate. Emphasizing this effect of climate change forces people to see an immediate threat to publichealth. Focusing on deaths from air pollution is also a useful strategy for urging action, since deaths fromparticulate matter and other types of air pollution are an immediate and tangible threat of poor environmentalquality.Especially in the northeastern states with shorelines, civic leaders will be interested in the effects of climatechange on recreational opportunities.  Tourism in these states is a crucial industry that provides a source of jobsin rural areas that would otherwise have high unemployment rates, so it is crucial to provide detail about howclimate change will affect these natural resources. There was good information about this subject presented inthe chapter.",The authors have considered this comment and revised the text where appropriate.

Andrew,Pershing,141871,"WholeChapter",18. Northeast,,,,,,"This chapter is a challenge. It is not very well organized/edited nor is it written at the appropriate level for theNCA. The challenges begin with the key messages, which do not follow any particular logical structure.  Becausethese set the whole structure of the chapter, it means that the chapter does not follow a logical structure.There are some really interesting stories in the chapter that could make for stronger key messages.  Forexample, there is a powerful section on the increase in Lyme disease and West Nile virus.  How is ""people valuebeing healthy and climate change is making that challenging in the Northeast"" not a key message?Another unique aspect of this region that is completely absent is the story of the Regional Greenhouse GasInitiative.  RGGI spans most of the chapter domain and has reduced CO2 emissions from the energy sector whilekeeping costs increases below average.  This is an incredible success story from this region that is highlyrelevant to the NCA.",The chapter has been significantly revised to deal with these issues.
Andrew,Pershing,141872,Whole Page,18. Northeast,,642,,,,"These key messages are a bit of a mess. They feel like they were written by 5 (or more) different people andthat there was very little effort to make them work together in any way.  First, the chapter talks about seasons,then oceans & coasts, then rural, urban, then a non-key message, then a generic adaptation key message thatcontradicts a point in the oceans key message. The entire chapter would benefit from restructuring these keymessages to really focus on the unique aspects of the region.  One potential reorganization:-instead of all seasons, pick one.  The Northeast is known for its harsh winters, so why not talk about them?  Youcould then bring in recreation, and maple sugaring. There is solid science, a strong climate connection,ecosystem impacts, and economic impacts. An alternative would be to focus on hydrology and extremeprecipitation as a unique driver recognized in this region.-Urban. Since urban is so much about infrastructure, you could bring in carbon reductions through RegionalGreenhouse Gas Initiative and also bring in some of the ideas from KM4 (which isn't written as a KM)-Rural-Oceans and coasts. Consider motivating this with coastal communities (both urban and rural) depend onservices...-Disease. This is one of the strongest points in the entire chapter. Consider elevating it to a KM",Thank you for your comments. The Key Messages have been substantially revised.
Andrew,Pershing,141873,Text Region,18. Northeast,,642,642,3,9,"The logic of this KM is unclear to this reviewer. It seems like you want to talk about shifts in the timing of theseasons (earlier spring, later fall transitions), but it is written in an absolute sense (warmer, colder).  This makes itseem like a generic climate change catch-all, rather than something really unique.","We appreciate this suggestion.

TaÃ-nos were the first civilization encountered by European explorers upon their arrival in the Americas(Keegan & Maclachlan, 1989) and the last Amerindian manifestation in the Caribbean that goes back 300B.C.(RodrÃ-guez-Ramos, 2008).  Indigenous families have residing in the same exact location or area for centuriesbeing enriched with knowledge about places that is transferred from generations through are found in the northCaribbean.  Countries such as Cuba, Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico are places in where the descendantsfrom that first encounter are still residing and using TEK from pre-Colombian ancestors.  Even if the language isnot fluently speak anymore, words are still present in the vocabulary of Spanish and non-Spanish speakers.Many words and conceptual natural phenomena that explain landscapes, islands, and agricultural practices arestill embedded in culturally knowledge.  Such information and philosophy can be potentially used asreinforcement for instruction and developing of culturally relevant science material.  The better organization anddevelopment of such material can be acquired through applied ethnographic work and historic literature. Manycontemporary work in linguistic, traditions, and ethnosciences (including ethnogeology and ethnobotany) isdedicated to share along the Caribbean such knowledge and practices.Since pre-colonial times both islands, Hispaniola and Puerto Rico, have shared many ecological, geological andanthropological events.  Both island share a close ethnohistoric evolution (Bukhari, Luis, Alfonso-Sanchez, Garcia-Bertrand, & Herrera, n.d., Stevens-Arroyo, 1993) as well as cultural norms and both have similar surfacetopography and geology, specially karst terrain.  Karst is one of the geological features that have been animportant piece in the development of cultural norms and well as for resources (Day, 2010) in many parts of theCaribbean. The existing interaction between karst and the people among people within the two countries is inthe knowledge that comes from the indigenous TaÃ-no culture, a civilization dating from pre-Columbian timesthat had a close relationship with the karst terrain.  Part of this relationship includes karst features that areembedded in creation stories, ceremonial locations and practices, artistic expressions, family stories, as well asplace-names among other issues (Alvarez Nazario, 1972; Dominguez-Cristobal, 1989, 1992, 2007; PanÃ©,1999).

There is not much information about causation ormechanisms.  Including the results of relevant process models would provide a broader scientific perspectiveand provide more mechanistic insight on the potential effects of climate change.  Most Midwest forests havehigh species diversity, which suggests that there should be options for persistence of hardwood forests andmaintenance of functionality, even though species distribution and abundance may change.","We encourage the reviewer to read the cited literature to gain an accurate understanding of the kinds of modelsused in the forestry Key Message. In particular, discussion in the forestry Key Message drew heavily from fourprocess models and one species distribution model used in the following publications: Brandt et al. 2014, 2017;Handler et al. 2014a, b; Iverson et al. 2016; Janowiak 2014b; Swanston et al. 2017. The Brandt, Handler,Iverson, and Janowiak publications provide detailed discussion of the relative structure and assumptions of thespecies distribution and process models; the combined results of these models were used in consideredassessments of species and ecosystem vulnerability. As an example, the LINKAGES and LANDIS PRO processmodels work together using inputs such as growing degree days, photosynthetically active radiation, andprecipitation and temperature values (and many others) to simulate climate interactions with establishment,growth, mortality, competition, and succession. We appreciate the suggestion to include more discussion ofecological mechanisms and relative model structure in the forestry Key Message, but space is limited. We referthose interested in a deeper treatment of statistical or simulated modeling of ecosystem function to the providedcitations. The authors emphasize that the cultural and economic interactions of people with Midwestern forestsextends beyond viewing them simply as “hardwoods”; in fact, there are numerous forest types and communitiesthat people value highly with the current species abundance and structure, and would consider it a loss if theidentities of those forest communities were to change.

Michael,MacCracken,144542,Text Region,21. Midwest,,862,862,9,9,"From the time of the first assessment, I thought the model results projected that is was very likely that climatechange would reduce lake levels (the increase in evaporative loss due to higher temperatures and reduction inice extent) being larger than the effect of any additional precipitation of the watershed, which is not much largerthan the lakes themselves. That level of confidence was questioned in government review process (under Bush2) and I had to explain that something like 11 of 12 modeling results showed this. Is this indication of sign now indoubt (indicated by using ""may"") and if so how is early reasoning wrong?","""May"" is now changed to ""will more likely than not"" and citation of Lofgren and Rouhana (2016) is added at thispoint. Lofgren and Rouhana (2016) bludgeoned the method that had nearly universally been used to projectGreat Lakes levels under climate change between 1989 and 2010, with the formulation of the land in the basin,not the lakes themselves, being the main source of the problem. The most extreme result found by Lofgren andRouhana was that, using one particular GCM's results as input to the original Croley method, the potentialevapotranspiration in the Lake Superior basin's land increased by an amount equivalent to having 565 suns inthe sky. Problematic assumptions in the original Croley method include: 1. The assumption that increased airtemperature causes increased evapotranspiration was taken far too literally, excluding even the effect of daylength that is included in other simplified calculations of potential evapotranspiration. 2. Evapotranspirationextracted directly from GCM output is to be categorically ignored, even for the sake of comparison, despitesignificant advances in that aspect of GCMs between 1989 and 2010, and even before. 3. Extreme andconvoluted calibration that minimizes error in runoff during the historical period of calibration will lead to a modelthat can be extended to other climatic regimes. 4. A simple energy constraint based on annually averagedincoming solar radiation applied only during the calibration process will ensure energy conservation in whatevertime and climate regime the model is applied, so an explicit conservation of energy constraint is not required.The 565 suns problem strongly suggests that this last one is wrong, and GCMs since the 1960s have hadschemes that explicitly conserve energy at the surface. To illuminate problems with temperature-basedcalculation of potential ET, see also Milly and Dunne(2016, Nature) and others by that research group andbeyond, although none of their results show problems as extreme as those in the Croley method. Here's whathappened with the 11 out of 12 cases: Each of those cases used data from a different GCM realization, but eachof those datasets was funneled through the same off-line hydrologic models used in the Croley method, whichwas where the problem lay. Contrary to the way this was often described at that time, the GCMs themselvesnever projected lake levels, but required the intermediary of the Croley method. During the Bush 2 era was whenthis increasingly became an internal NOAA struggle between Dr. Croley (more senior scientist) and Dr. Lofgren(junior scientist). It didn't hit the literature until Lofgren et al. (2011, J. Great Lakes Res.), but was still taken lightlyenough in such secondary literature as NCA3 that the more thorough treatment of Lofgren and Rouhana (2016)was deemed necessary.

For example Austin went to one day per week watering restrictions and other strong droughtmeasures for all but 6 weeks of a 4 and three quarters year period from September 2011 to May 2016.  TheCity's drought response was essential in contributing to the lakes staying above the direst emergency levels.Also, the finances of Austin's water utility, Austin Water, were severely affected by the drought.  Austin Waterworked diligently with the Austin City Council and community to implement significant business modeladaptations to provide increased financial stability for the water utility as the drought progressed.  Additionally,water oriented businesses upstream of Austin were damaged by the drought.  And, the drought broughtincreased risk of wildfires. In fact there were two severe fires in areas near Austin in 2011, if not caused by thedrought, then either aggravated or heightened by the drought.Also note that water supply rationing did not actually occur.  Through drought contingency plan implementationand dramatic cutback efforts by the City of Austin, including the response by Austin's citizenry, and others andaction of other entities including the curtailment of interruptible water customers including rice farmingoperations, through the river authority's water management plan for the basin, while close, the basin was able tostave off reaching emergency rationing levels.",The text was revised to take into account this perspective.

Indeed, I've been suggesting that the way we ought to be talking about sea level rise is not to give arange in a particular year but to give an increase in sea level (1 m, 2 m, etc.) and give a range in time when thislevel is projected to occur. So, with regard to the statement here, it is really not whether sea level will reach 4feet or not but when this might occur as we do seem to be really committed to at least this much, and does itreally matter much if this is in 2100 or 2140, etc.--in either case, the issue will be retreat from the coastline, etc.So, here, I'd suggest making the point something like this (more briefly here, expanded in text) ""as mid-rangeprojections of sea level rise suggest a rise of up to a few feet by the end of the century and at least an equivalentamount of rise during the next century, occurring potentially earlier if emissions are not reduced and up to a fewcenturies later if emissions are reduced.""","The Key Message was modified to include the timeframe of 2100. We did not address continuation beyond2100 because 2100 appears to be the outer levels of confidence (CCSR does not project beyond 2100).

With less cold air coming south from Canada (at leasthappening a bit less often--and that trend will likely continue), warm Gulf of Mexico air has on occasionpenetrated in to Denver region, etc., and ends up leading, under the right situation, to lots of snow on the easternslope of the Rockies (and when the penetrates further north, it dumps on the northern Great Plains and can floodthe Missouri River, etc., when it melts as the region is not (yet) hydrographically well carved by large runoffs.",The text has been modified to distinguish the rivers in the SGP that are not impacted by snow melt.

For example, in theSoutheast, the air has often been quite humid and yet they have had a drought--I'd suggest because thesummertime air masses coming out of Canada that in the past have triggered thunderstorms are, due to globalwarming, no longer as cool and massive. Here on the Atlantic coastal plain, I sense (however inaccurate that islikely to be) that the weaker cool fronts out of Canada are no longer deep and strong enough in mid-to latesummer to pour over the Appalachians and then trigger thunderstorms in the humid air that is present--and sowe get dry periods. I'd suggest that instead of always talking about the climate, we go back a bit to thinkingabout the weather systems that trigger precipitation and how they are changing and why--and then what that islikely to mean for the future.","The role of undercutting cooler air in modulating Southern Great Plains drought has not yet been investigated.Therefore, we have not changed the original text."

However, this ignores the nuances ofinterstate (and potentially international, in the Northwest) management of fisheries, which may include thecontinuation of fishing rights with the original fishing fleet until serious (and potentially lengthy) negotiationshave been completed. For example, North Carolina fishermen have one of the largest federal fishing quotas forblack sea bass; as the species shifts itsâ€TM distribution north, the North Carolina fishermen have retained theirquota allocation. So even though black sea bass are occurring in greater abundance off of the New Jersey / NewYork coast, fishermen there still have to respect federal quota allocations, and so additional fishing opportunitieshave yet to open up for northeastern fishermen in this fishery.The role of management in opening new fishing opportunities in response to range shifts could also bementioned in the section â€œChallenges, Opportunities, and Success Stories of Reducing Risk.â€","We appreciate this comment and the detailed example provided; however, within the space limitations, thislevel of detail and speculation about changes in management/regulations is not appropriate.

However, we hoped for more synthesis so that business owners or policymakers in the Northwest could use Chapter 24 as a guide for impacts planning or creating adaptation legislation.Similarly, the text provides little quantification of the magnitude of the projected climate impacts, or their relativeimportance compared to each other or non-climatic risks and vulnerabilities.

It would be helpful to begin by defining infrastructure, and perhaps breakdowninto several types. One of the most critical implications of linkages of climate to infrastructure is the vastinterconnectedness of infrastructure.  Without electricity, water canâ€TMt be treated, and cell tower and hospitalgenerators eventually run out of fuel.  If trees and powerlines are down on the road, then emergency responseis hampered and supply routes are cut off.  This highlights the impact of wind and ice storms that may be tied tomore extreme weather.This section could be strengthened by tying infrastructure to health and safety.  When a severe storm knocksout power and roads, the first issues are health and safety, not the economy. Infrastructure was designed tohistorical climate, but also the environmental conditions resulting from that climate, such as the hydrology or fireregime.Additional citations to consider:â€¢        Douglas, E., Jacobs, J., Hayhoe, K., Silka, L., Daniel, J., Collins, M., ... & Mallick, R.

Your point is supported by our examples fromfloodng in Tillamook County, the important of ""lifelines"" in the Washington DOT analysis, and the map of shallowgroundwater wells (Fig. 24.3). Notably, two of these examples were found in literature or data produced by theDepartments of Health for Oregon and Washington, respectively.We have added references to Strauch et al (2015).

Southwest,,1091,1091,4,5,"A portion of Key Message 1--""increasing water demands from a growing population""--is not supported by thetext in that section, and in fact is apparently contradicted by statements on p. 1092, lines 7-11, about per-capitaor total water use declining from 20-38% in CA, NV, and CO in recent years. Suggest deleting this statementunless the section cites regional analyses which demonstrate increasing total municipal water use in recentyears. Reductions in per-capita use like those cited are keeping pace with population growth in several SW cities,so that total municipal use is stable or declining, but it is not clear whether this holds across the SW region.","We thank the reviewer for the comment. The reductions noted were for temporary measures. Indeed, wateruse in California has now rebounded to pre-drought levels according to recent newspaper reports. Seehttps://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/10/california-water-use-continues-to-increase-as-conservation-declines/. The reviewer is correct that per capita and indeed total water use in many cities is either remaining flator decreasing (See J. Fleck's book). However, in other places, municipalities have been active in seeking newsupplies. These actions in some cases have been forward looking, rather than to meet immediate needs. TheSouthern Nevada Water Authority continues the process of acquiring water rights in northeastern Nevada. St.George, Utah is pursuing a ~ 100 kaf/year pipeline from Lake Powell. The Metropolitan Water District ofSouthern California has continued to investigate fallowing opportunities on the Colorado River (e.g. Bard summerfallowing program, admittedly small but potentially bigger in the future). In the Front Range of Colorado, stateplanning documents indicate a large supply-demand gap of approximately 560 kaf to meet growth in thedecades ahead, some of which is expected to come from the Colorado River. Colorado expects to almost doubleits population from 5m to 10m by 2050. A pipeline proposal from Wyoming to the Colorado Front Range hasresurfaced which would move 55 kaf/year for municipal use.https://www.sltrib.com/news/environment/2018/02/27/entrepreneur-revives-zombie-pipeline-proposal-to-carry-green-river-water-from-utah-to-colorado/ The Central Arizona Project is pursuing the acquisition of farmlands in Mohave County to assist with firming supplies for its canal, some of which is used for municipal uses.The recent system conservation efforts in the Colorado River Basin have been funded in large part bymunicipalities desiring to firm reservoir supplies. The Southwest is one of the fastest growing regions in thecountry and this growth drives at least some municipal entities to be proactive about their future needs evenwhile they are making substantial progress on water conservation."

Thus, the notion that the SWis ""under the hottest and driest climate"" in the US is an unhelpful generalization that elides the enormous spatialvariability in temperature and precipitation regimes across the region--and it's not even true, if ""hottest"" isinterpreted as ""highest annual average temperatures"", for which the SE US is hotter overall.The implication of this statement appears to be that SW, being already hot and dry, is especially vulnerable tofurther warming and drying.

Attention to indigenous peoples iscertainly important. However, they are not the only groups with history, heritage, and attachment to landscapesin the Southwest. The framing of this section leaves out centuries of Hispanic settlement and the history of otherEuropean arrivals and lives in this region. Other major themes that are missing include: Gold Rush history andother mining/extractive industries; development of cattle ranching; early of water infrastructure. Authors shouldexamine -- why is it indigenous peoples are recognized as having history that is important and relevant to themand their adaptation, but other communities in the region do not? It may be appropriate to add another keymessage.","We appreciate this comment. However, with limited space, it is necessary to focus on a few themes. This is notto imply that other themes are not important. Part of the determination to focus on Indigenous peoples waslearning from the previous assessments, which included that Indigenous peoples and communities are amongthose experiencing and witnessing climate change impacts first and foremost, and among those leading inactions to adapt to and mitigate such impacts. As such, a distinct need was articulated to not only have astandalone Tribal and Indigenous Peoples Chapter, but that tribal-related issues are part of each region as well.Indigenous communities are certainly not the only frontline communities and not the only ones with importantlocal knowledge. We recognize that there are other place-based subsistence communities whose livelihoods,practices, values, and life ways are also deeply rooted to the land. There are also other frontline communities inurban locales that are at the forefront of climate impacts and environmental injustices. However, tribes andIndigenous peoples are particularly unique  with their status as sovereign nations, extensive traditionalhomelands upon which they have dwelled for millennia, and Indigenous knowledges developed overgenerations of long-term observations about changes occurring to the ecosystems, water bodies, plant andanimal species, air, and land."

Jeff,Lukas,143603,Text Region,25. Southwest,,1089,1089,32,33,"The specific assertion that there has been a â€œ20% reduction of [Southwest] snowpack and its water contentsince 1950â€is not directly attributable to Fyfe et al. 2017 (hereafter F17) or Pierce et al. 2008 (hereafter P08),contrary to the citations of those two studies.F17 found that there was a 10-20% reduction in annual maximum SWE (SWEmax) between the periods 1982-1991 and 2001-2010, over a domain that covers the entire Western US, i.e. about double the area of the 6-stateSW region.F17 expressed their main findings as a range since they analyzed two types of SWE data:1)        The 10% reduction was calculated from the in-situ SNOTEL observational network; this result is likely bothmore robust and more comparable with prior SWE analyses, though with the caveats about data omission andexclusion given below.2)        The 20% reduction was derived from the average of four gridded reanalysis datasets; the robustness ofthe SWE output from these reanalyses has not been rigorously assessed.For 1 above, F17 analysed only SNOTEL data from the NRCS network, which has relatively few sites in California.Most of the in-situ SWE observations in CA are from the California Dept. of Water Resourceâ€TMs network(functionally equivalent to SNOTEL), whose data were not analysed by F17. Thus California is under-representedin their analysis 1. F17 also excluded all sites below 1500m, for unknown reasons. This excludes a handful ofSNOTEL sites in CA, and many dozens of sites in OR, WA, ID, and MT, further affecting analysis 1.These issues, combined with the difference in coverage between the SW region and the much larger F17domain (affecting analyses 1 and 2), mean that it is unclear how the F17 findings for regionally averagedSWEmax trend (both 1 and 2) might scale to the smaller SW region. We can say that F17 shows (in Figure 1)that the vast majority of SNOTEL sites in the SW region declined in SWEmax between 1982-1991 and 2000-2010.P08 found that from 1950-1999, the ratio of April 1 SWE to March-April precipitation (SWE/P), had declined from5-20% across a Westwide domain similar to that used by F17. SWE was taken from manually measuredsnowcourses, which are mostly co-located with current SNOTEL sites. While the SWE/P metric isimportantâ€”arguably more so than SWE itselfâ€”it does not speak clearly to trends in SWE. In fact, P08 foundthat the site-based trends in SWE from 1950-1999 mainly ranged from +6% to -10%, with 71% of the trends","We thank the reviewer for the comment.

If a longer or more intense drought, onemight build bigger reservoirs to hold more in reserve from wet years; if instead a declining baseline is thedominant influence, one needs to reduce demand long-term and find additional supplies (desalination).

Moreover, in the Southwest, there is better attribution of other factors that reduce increasethe likelihood of drought, and reduce the water reliability. In revision of an earlier part of this section of text tosupport Key Message 1, we acknowledge the effects of temperature increase as a preview of more commonand arid future conditions for the region.

For this reason, future changesoutside the range projected by climate models cannot be ruled out (very high confidence). Moreover, thesystematic tendency of climate models to underestimate temperature change during warm paleoclimatessuggests that climate models are more likely to underestimate than to overestimate the amount of long-termfuture change (medium confidence).” (Chapter 15) The supporting evidence and traceable accounts for thesekey messages are available from NCA4 Vol. 1, Chapters 1, 4, and 15."
George,Backus,141846,Text Region,26. Alaska,,1190,1190,19,19,"The economic consequences of climate change seem a bit one-sided and narrow in this chapter. The Arctic isbecoming a newly accessible ocean. Completely discounting the idea that technological change and economicconditions could not cause rapidly unfolding consequences, possibly similar to those associated with the newlyaccessible Atlantic and the Pacific Oceans of the 16th century, seems overly focused on an exceptionality of thepresent. It is reminiscent of the â€œThis Time is Differentâ€misguided view of modern financial markets.Although it is assumed in the report that climate will be drastically different than the historical conditions,technology and economic sophistication are treated as statically locked in the present.

Hawai'i and PacificIslands",,1265,1265,13,19,"This is the present text:13 Key Message 6: Climate change impacts in the Pacific Islands are expected to amplify existing14 risks and lead to compounding economic, environmental, social, and cultural costs. For15 example, climate change impacts on ecological and social systems may result in severe16 disruptions to livelihoods that increase the risk of human conflict or compel the need for17 migration. Early interventions, already occurring in some places across the region, can18 prevent costly and lengthy rebuilding of communities and livelihoods, and minimize19 displacement and relocation.Comment: This entire message falsely states speculative projections of impacts as established physical facts.These attributions, projections and risks appear to be based primarily on the use of questionable computermodels. That climate change will have negative impacts has yet to be determined and appears increasinglyunlikely.","This comment is inconsistent with the author team’s thorough assessment of the science. This statementrepresents the scientific understanding of climate change or the assessment of the peer-reviewed literaturefound in NCA4 Volume 1 [Climate Science Special Report, the CSSR]; that volume provides the underlyingscientific basis for the impacts analyses provided in Volume 2, and this Chapter and Key Message.

Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,,,,,"It could be helpful to add at least a paragraph explaining the relationship between adaptation and otherfrequently discussed concepts like vulnerability, adaptive capacity, and resilience.  Here is a suggestedparagraph: Adaptation can help reduce vulnerability to climate change impacts, where Â“vulnerability"" is Â“afunction of the character, magnitude, and rate of climate variations to which a system is exposed, its sensitivity,and its adaptive capacity"" (Bierbaum et al. 2014, 672). Here, Â“adaptive capacity"" means the Â“potential of asystem to adjust to climate change (including climate variability and extremes) to moderate potential damages,take advantage of opportunities, and cope with the consequences."" (Bierbaum et al. 2014, 672). Resilience cansupport successful adaptation and reduce long-term vulnerability. (Cutter et al. 2008, 600; Adger, Arnell, andTompkins 2005, 79, 83; Nelson, Adger, and Brown 2007, 400). Resilience is the idea that a community canweather through and bounce back from adversity by having the right kind of resources or Â“capitals"" and theflexibility to draw on those most readily available.

To make KeyMessage 5 more consistent with Key Message 3 of this chapter, I suggest the following rewrite: ""Many benefitsof adaptation can be realized by integrating climate considerations into organizations' and government entities'current risk management activities (mainstreaming).

Susanne,Moser,141795,"WholeChapter","28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,,,,,"The Adaptation chapter as a whole does not constitute an objective or well informed assessment. It reads moreoften like a textbook rather than an assessment; in many places it is vague - something the ""may, can, could, ormight police"" in NCA3 was serious about avoiding - and therefore is unhelpful for researchers or decision-makers; and it includes a number of overt or hidden normative statements. What is its more serious flaw,however, is that it is dated, uninformed, does not provide adequate perspective, and is in many instances rosy-eyed and unsupported by evidence. I will provide a few sample passages where that is the case, but having justcompleted a serious assessment of the state of adaptation as a field of practice in the US, I find this chapterlargely to be a document of wishful thinking. It is wholly inadequate as a definitive federal document reflectingthe state of adaptation in the US. It simply and categorically does not.The traceable account suggests the author team did a ""comprehensive"" literature review and consulted experts,who are not named or counted, so this does not provide very convincing evidence that this search andconsultation was thorough.For example, the current reference list consists of 109 references (it is incomplete, but I can only work with whatis presented); more than half (!) of these references are pre-NCA3. So, a total of 52 references are post 2014. Bycomparison, a quick Web of Science search for these terms:yields 223 references. So, a first indication that the literature search was not comprehensive.More importantly, SO MUCH of what is going on in the adaptation arena is reflected in non-peer-reviewedjournal articles, and yet often well researched and peer-reviewed. This body of work is generally termed ""greyliterature"" but is permissible (and other chapters in the assessments rely on such references). That body of workis 100% missing from this assessment. It reads therefore like the authors simply do not know what is going on inAmerica.I will make more specific comments separately to reflect how these omissions make this chapter essentiallybiased or useless. I am sorry to have to say this.I will send several documents to the review email and urge the author team to read those documents to sharpenthe assessment.","We thank the reviewer for the comment.  We have included more citations in our revised draft, have removedat least some of the ""may, can, and woulds"", and revised those sections that might have led the reviewer toconsider us as ""rosey-eyed.""

This is a good example of how this chapter isbiased and wholly unsupported by adequate evidence.The section claims early on that since NCA3 adaptation has ""increased significantly"" in scale and scope, which isgraphically depicted in Figure 28.1. I want to know where the author team comes up with that conclusion. itsPRIMARY reference given as evidence is the Bierbaum article which was commissioned PRIOR to 2014 for NCA3,and it concluded - see the title of the paper - that adaptation is progressing but not enough. its key take homemessage was tampered down even further by all the other evidence accumulated in all the chapters of NCA3 tothe conclusion that Melillo et al 2014 came to, namely that we were not seeing many examples ofimplementation. So, one pre-NCA3 paper is given as evidence that we have progressed beyond the NCA3statement?Several more paragraphs on p. 1313 claim there is evidence of progress, but provide not a single reference.Then at the top of p.1314, therre are several other references - one about progress of federal agencies - whichwas mandated under Obama and is now seriously curtailed and this is not in any way acknowledged; and thentwo legal papers and the tribal chapter. In the accompanying traceable account, the paper also refs to Vogel etal 2016 - a compilation of case studies expressely claiming NOT to be representative of the US and includingcase studies that do NOT consider anthropogenic climate change or forward-looking climate information; and areview paper by Stults and Meerow that explicitly says that implementation is seriously hindered. Nor does itinclude a broader set of references of barrier studies or reviews of case studies or other reviews that concludejust the opposite of the author team.How in the world can the authors claim that the country as a whole has moved into implementation? Because ofmaybe 2 or 3 dozen projects that have been successful in overcoming major funding and institutional hurdles?How can THAT become the story if hundreds, maybe more, communities can't get beyond the planning stage,and when thousands haven't even begun yet??? This comment exemplifies (and note, there are many moreunsupported statements like this throughout the chapter) what I call wishful thinking, bias, and lack ofgroundedness in the reality of adaptation in the US.A better informed chapter would consider the long list of studies and reviews on barriers to adaptation; it wouldseriously consider a comprehensive review of the adaptation field just published by the Kresge Foundation (as","We thank the review for the comment, which we found very helpful.

Rebecca,Ambresh,141797,Text Region,"28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,1314,1316,24,4,"This set of comments pertains to KM2. This message and supporting text and traceable account are bizarre tome.First the word ""assumptions"" - this suggests people's perceptions or choices, but it seems mostly what theauthors want to convey here is about standards and similar institutional barriers that prevent decision-makersfrom taking forward-looking climate information into account. The section would be exceedingly clearer if theauthors distinguished where people's perceptions and choices (where they have them) are the problem, andwhere existing institutional requirements are the problem.For the first dimension of this KM, there is absolutely no evidence brought to the table. But there is. Lots ofpeople talk about ""adapting"" when really they just deal with a disaster and then build back to the pre-disasterstatus without looking to the future. New Jersey after Sandy is a good example and literature exists on this now;especially in comparison to New York, where the future was taken into account! The Vogel et al reference alsoincludes examples of people doing that. There is literature on how there are still places in teh US you can't talkabout climate change and so it gets ignored in hazard mitigation efforts. Where is any of this here?The second dimension of this KM, which is about codes, regulations and standards that prevent even the willingfrom building back better and be forward-looking is a type of institutional barrier and there is growing literatureon that. The efforts of ASCE are misrepresented as ""the engineering community is already overcoming this.""FAR from it. The AsCE document offers a framework and makes very high-level recommendations about whatSHOULD be done. But that is a far cry from doing it already. If the author team knew more about how difficultand lengthy it is to change codes and standards, such a lofty, rosy eyed statement would not be made.I have the entire chapter marked red because it makes so many generalized claims that are unsupported, I trulydo not even know where to begin.",We thank the reviewer for the comment.  We have revised the KM and give examples of the points made
Susanne,Moser,141800,Text Region,"28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,1316,1318,5,28,"This set of comments is about KM 3. I read this section as a piece from a text book. It simply reiterates whatmany have said, namely that adaptation is a form of iterative risk management and people should get on withit. The NCA3 said as much. So, what here is new or worth repeating or the novel insight? I don't see any.On p.1316, ln. 35-39, there is a moment of something interesting here, namely that this allegedly suitableiterative risk management framework would help connect to sectors (e.g., the private sector) where this type ofthinking is already common. Well, an assessment that would have something useful and new to say, wouldassess to what extent this framework is being used (i.e. how widespread this thinking has become), and to whatextend it does help with cross-sector integration and coordination.That said, i have a more fundamental problem with the claim. with all the emphasis on local adaptation, thetypical leads on adaptation are local government planners, or maybe public works or environment or healthdepartment staff. Sometimes explicitly sustainability or resilience officers. NONE of them have been trained inrisk management and are NOT at all familiar with this framework. I just recently had a conversation with one ofthe best local planners in California and he said, ""we don't know how to do this risk assessment andmanagement."" So, one problematic part with this KM is that there is evidence that experts think this is the rightframework, but there is no evidence that it has become that. And so, an assessment ought to dig up why that isthe case and what hinders its adoption. Not just claim it's the way to go like a textbook or even advocacy piecemight.And then finally, where is the critical perspective that a real assessment needs? Iterative risk assessment isinherently reactive to new risk information, and recommends courses of action (and iterative updating of action)based on the available information. This is clearly better than not taking into account risk and uncertainty,surely, but iterative risk assessment is only as good as it captures all parts of a system, the interactions of thosesystems, and enables trade-off and synergy analyses, and each one of these aspects is limited by the currentstate of science, the current state of sophistication of adaptation professionals, service providers andpractitioners. And NONE of it takes account of the famous ""unknown unknowns"" and completely surprisingdiscontinuities, which become increasingly likely, but no more predicatable (suitable for risk assessment) in asystem that is pushed so hard as we currently are pushing climate change. So, iterative risk management hasserious blind spots. And this text does not acknowledge a single one of them. Precautionary approaches do so","Thank you. We disagree with all the many and various claims in this comment. The utility of an adaptivemanagement framework has been documented in the references already cited in this chapter. The capacity foradapting to surprise or unplanned-for events is expressly recognized in the emphasis on learning and revisingwithin applications of the adaptive management framework as illustrated by the examples we include."

Can't the team sharpen that?More problematic is that most of the text is text-bookish, rather than assessing the available information, howgood it is, what therefore can be said and not said about cost-effectiveness; and it says practically nothing aboutthe challenges local communities have making the economic case for adaptation, even if adaptation is cost-effective.I urge the author team to carefully read documents sent to the review email - one is a US-wide assessment ofthe adaptation field, where the difficulty of making the economic case was carefully addressed. And the secondis a study of adaptation finance challenges experienced by local governments in CA. It includes an extensiveliterature review of the pertinent literature globally and the US, and shows - on the basis of a document analysiswhat adaptation really costs. It is by far more expensive than is typically claimed; many cost items of theadaptation process are not included; AND YET it is cost-effective, compared to the cost of inaction (which is alsoseriously lacking in how it is assessed.The point is, the author team could do a MUCH more thorough job of actually saying something serious, usefuland reality-based.There are serious problems with Table 28.1, one being that most of the citations are pre-NCA3; furthermore thetext contextualizes NOTHING about these studies (e.g., property buy-outs are not cost-effective given theunderlying constraints on who CBA should be done, they often are absolutely cost effective if the full life cycle ofa structure is considered, but the author team discusses none of this, which either illustrates lack of awareness orbias); all the items in black ink have no references at all; the message it sends therefore is truly problematic!The text should be searched systematically for all mentions of ""can""  or ""could"" or ""appear to"" or ""may"" etc. andbe replaced with serious conditional statements as when something does or doesn't do x, y, z. Each should be bebacked-up by literature. yet again, that type of language creates a textbook feeling, not an assessment. Thischapter should have something serious to say about where, to what extent and under what circumstancesadaptation has been shown to be cost effective. And the references should be mostly post NCA3. The ones citedhere are mostly pre-2013.The section claims on p.1321 that there is ""considerable literature on the cost of actions"", but there is practicallyno  evidence of that in this section.

Should be try non-bestpractices?Besides this making no sense at all, the section fails to be an assessment one more time. Tell me three things that are best practices? Then shop it around and see if three more people agree with thatlist. The Kresge field assessment just released makes exceedingly clear that the field doesn't know what bestpractices are, and if anything, that would be useful to say in an assessment chapter, but then the chapter goesinto a textbooking treatment (inadequate at that!) of mainstreaming and ultimately says it may not be enough.Well, that is so unhelpful.An assessment could assess how widespread mainstreaming is. It could assess how well that is going and whatthe outcomes of that approach is. It could assess whether there are drawbacks. It could assess up to what pointthat is a good idea and provide insights when it is not. And since it mentions that there is something beyondmainstreaming, it could actually draw on the growing transformational adaptation literature and say what that isabout, why and when it's needed, and to what extent that has advanced since NCA3.This chapter fails on every single point. It does none of this.It also conflates mainstreaming with incremental change with illustrates that the authors are not familiar withthe literature on mainstreaming or the literature on transformational change.Transformational change can begin very much in an incremental fashion, in fact, most transformations proceedthat way.The chapter is also full of ""can"" and ""may"" statements; all of which should be replaced with hard-hittingconditional statements that explain when something does x,y,z and when it does not, and be followed bysupporting references, i.e. evidence. In a series of instances these words just look like ridicuous attempts toavoid saying some hard truth (e.g., without GHG reductions we ""may"" have to do more extensive changes... anorganization ""may be"" required to use historical climate information."" - both of these are facts!!).

Emily,Seyller,142386,"WholeChapter","28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,,,,,"1. Assessment of adaptation responses or climate impacts? I appreciate the team's attempt to assess the stateof adaptation in the U.S. It's a tough job to do! However, as I read this chapter, I felt as though most of thechapter was focused on assessing the impacts and convincing the reader that there are risks and examples ofwhy adaptation is needed versus what adaptation actions are being taken and assessing where we are inadapting to changes in climate and extreme weather events. I came away asking myself: Is the objective of thischapter to ""assess adaptation responses"" or ""assess the impacts of climate change?"" The way it's written in thiscurrent draft is more towards the latter. I wanted to see concrete examples of the ""significant"" adaptationactions being implemented across the U.S. at a variety of scales.  Also the chapter title says: ""Near-TermAdaptation Needs and Increased Resiliency"" but when downloading the actual chapter, it's labeled as""Adaptation Responses."" This is confusing in itself.2. What does ""significant"" mean? In Key Message 1, you open up by stating that ""implementation hassignificantly increased, but is not yet commonplace."" Throughout the entire chapter, I really don't get a sensethat ""significant"" implementation has occurred since the Third NCA. How do you quantify ""significant""? Whatdoes ""significant"" mean to the chapter authors? And what data and information do you have to back that up? Itwasn't clear to me through the minimal examples that were provided in the current draft. The term ""significant""is used throughout the draft without evidence to back that up. If it's used, I would recommend adding in someconcrete examples to support that statement. Having the traceable accounts is incredibly helpful as that backs itup with literature. But I wanted to see a quantifiable approach with the evidence illustrating that ""significant""meant a certain number of on-the-ground projects, etc.3. Include more concrete examples of adaptation being implemented at a variety of scales. Similar to myprevious comment of the entire draft, I was looking for many more examples of adaptation actions beingimplemented throughout the U.S. (even just pulled out the actual text if they're embedded in there and put intocall-out boxes). Given that this is supposed to be an assessment of adaptation responses and and increasedresiliency, I would have hoped to have seen more examples. I would also recommend that you explain thedifference between adaptation and resilience as these terms mean different things to different people, sectors,and organizations.4. Diversify the images throughout. Most of the images captions were related to water and flooding. Try and","We have dropped ""significant"" from the language of KM1.  We are assessing adaptation responses.  Hopefullyour revised chapter makes that clear."

The reader needs tounderstand why it's so critical to invest in adaptation actions now because we're ALREADY experiencing changesin our climate and extreme weather events. A ""Summary Overview"" should highlight the core componentswoven throughout the entire chapter instead of being a technical description of why we need to adapt. That canbe put after the summary overview, and beef up the summary overview with reasons why this is so importantand the urgency here to truly grab the readers attention from the start.The Summary Overview should also give the reader some hope illustrating how beneficial adaptation can be topeople, places, and things - highlighting co-benefits to adaptation actions and the economic savings that goalong with investing in adaptation now.",We have re-written the summary.

In the Third NCA Adaptation chapter, there are a few examples that were provided so that the readerunderstood where the general steps originated for further transparency.It's also a little strange that monitoring and evaluation are separated...most adaptation processes I've seencombine those two.

Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,1312,1314,34,34,"It is worth noting some of the efforts that federal agencies have undertaken to get states and local communitiesto plan for and implement adaptation measures. HUD has overseen two efforts successful efforts in this regard:Rebuild By Design and the National Disaster Resilience Competition. Rebuild By Design was a design drivenapproach to create innovative local resilience solutions that was conducted in the aftermath of SuperstormSandy. It was structured to connect local communities with some of the nation's leading design firms tocollaboratively identify and solve problems and address vulnerabilities that were exposed by Superstorm Sandy.The design solutions for the winning proposals ranged in scope and scale -- from large-scale green infrastructureto small-scale residential resiliency retrofits. The competition process strengthened the understanding ofregional interdependencies, fostering coordination and resilience both at the local level and across the U.S.Ultimately, nine projects were selected for implementation and received CDBG-DR funding totaling $930 million.Each of the seven winning projects are moving forward, undergoing engineering studies and environmentalassessments, and will break ground in 2019. The program was such a success that HUD later used it as a modelfor the National Disaster Resilience Competition, which distributed nearly $1 billion in unallocated HUD CDBG-DRfunds to fourteen projects throughout the United States. FEMA has also taken steps to get states to pro-activelyaddress changing future conditions that result from climate change. In 2015 FEMA began requiring states toassess the impacts of climate change and how the frequency and magnitude of natural disasters may change inthe future and what actions the state may take to reduce their communities risks and vulnerabilities to thesenatural disasters.

Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,1315,1315,11,28,"Some specific examples of where the assumption of climate stationarity is hampering adaptation efforts areflood maps produced by FEMA (also known as Flood Insurance Rate Maps). These maps are the primary toolthat policy makers, developers, engineers, designers, local officials, and individuals use to determine their floodrisk. But these maps do not account for changing future conditions, and are based entirely on past storms andcurrent topography, bathymetry, etc. As such, our nation's primary risk communication tool for storms fallswoefully short of what's needed to inform the public about future flood risks. New York City is a location whereFEMA is working with the City to create more future oriented flood maps, which could serve as a model for othercoastal areas of the country (see https://www.nrdc.org/experts/rob-moore/nyc-will-get-flood-maps-consider-...). New York State has adopted regulations that anticipate future sea level rise and different estimates overvarious timescales and probabilities. These are worth citing, as they are a good example of the types of policiesgovernments at all levels should be incorporating into design standards for public buildings, facilities, andinfrastructure (see https://www.nrdc.org/experts/rob-moore/nyc-will-get-flood-maps-consider-...). A similarstandard was put in place by President Obama, known as the Federal Flood Risk Management Standard. Thiswould have required all federal agencies to ensure that projects they fund incorporated an additional margin ofsafety for flood risk and, where it made sense, incorporate projections of future sea level rise (seehttps://www.nrdc.org/experts/rob-moore/president-raises-flood-protection...).

As an example, in March 2017, the USGCRP SocialScience Coordinating Committee organized a workshop ""Social Science Perspectives on Climate Change"", thatbrought together federal researchers and managers as well as academic social scientists to discussunderstanding of drivers, vulnerability of and responses to climate change from four disciplines - anthropology,archaeology, geography and sociology. The workshop resulted in three USGCRP white papers Social SciencePerspectives on Climate Change (USGCRP 2018, Part 1, 2 & 3 - upcoming), each on (1) social vulnerability underclimate change; (2) drivers of and responses to climate change; and (3) innovative methods and tools toevaluate coupled natural and human systems. Paper (1) ""Social Vulnerability"" synthesizes the recent socialscience research and discusses key factors (e.g., resource access, culture, governance, and information) thatinfluence vulnerabilities within and across communities as well as insights for effective adaptation. Paper (2)discusses the underlying drivers of climate change and how these factors interact dynamically over space andtime. These white papers collectively highlight the importance to consider social, cultural, political, and economicfactors and past decisions for understanding drivers and vulnerability of climate change, and the need for multi-scaled, multi-dimensional approaches and governance structures for mitigation and adaptation responses.Discussions in this chapter can be enhanced by incorporating key insights from the white papers.",We now cite this work.

Allison,Crimmins,143473,"WholeChapter","28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,,,,,"This chapter needs a lot of work. Unfortunately, it is well behind the progress of most other chapters I've read. Itis incredibly repetitive and full of jargon. It reads like policy wonks wrote a brochure for other policy wonks, notlike scientists assessed the literature and synthesized it for a pubic audience. It is agonizing to read and way toolong, though because of redundancies it could easily be chopped in half. There is one figure and one table in thischapter and both are very poorly conceived. Most frustrating was the number of lists in this chapter (many ofwhich repeated themselves) and in some cases lists within lists. There were so many different frameworkstouted: first five steps, then a different five steps in Figure 1, then iterative framework, then a framework ofexposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, then a table of current and future changes that was incomprehensible,then another list of climate adaptation processes beginning on page 1324 (with a separate numbered list withinthe first bullet of this list), then mainstreaming (as a verb), then another framework of helpful factors of anadaptation plan.... I've completely lost how many frameworks there are. I'm not even sure why this chapterfocuses on all these different types of frameworks instead of just defining and describing what adaptation is andwhy it is needed. Most readers will not care what conceptual framework is better than another- that isn't therole of a scientific assessment. This chapter could be used for more, and better, purposes. It would also benefitfrom more quantitative descriptions and especially descriptions of whether the numerous examples (almost allin NYC, California, or Florida) have been effective. I suggest the authors revisit their key messages and givecareful thought to the messages they want to convey to this audience based on the literature assessed. It maybe as simple as 1) adaptation is needed 2) adaptation is cost effective 3) there are examples of this being donethat have been shown to be effective. Save the frameworks for other, more appropriate, reports.","We thank the reviewer for their comments and note that it differs from other feedback we have received, suchas that by the National Academy of Sciences review panel.

Allison,Crimmins,143490,Figure,"28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",1,1310,,,,"This figure needs replacing with something more useful to the chapter's audience, or at least a lot of revision. Asthe only figure in this chapter, it is unfortunate that this figure is focused on yet another framework, one thatdiffers from the one just discussed in the text and from the CDC BRACE framework and from the next 3-5frameworks discussed in this chapter. What about an image of a home with suggested examples of ways anindividual or family could take adaptation steps in their own home/neighborhood? What about a map withsuccessful adaptation measures marked on it? How about a graph or map showing how many cities and stateshave adaptation plans? Anything but another conceptual diagram with boxes and arrows. This figure isconfusing, not least because every project, everywhere would have a different mix and order of these stagesand they would all be at different stages (in other words, not every adaptation action is at the implementationstage now). So how can you say where NCA3 or NCA4 fall? This figure was already in NCA3 and in the 2014 NAS,which will be 4 or 5 years old by the time this report is released. I think the authors can do better and be morecreative than recycling this old conceptual diagram for each other.Beyond that, if the authors feel they must keep this diagram, there are many issues to work on. First, these arenot the same five stages outlined in the text. Second, the text says that we saw the first three stages occurring inNCA3, but here it only shows two. Third, the dotted dark blue arrow seems to imply that we have not made itany further than NCA3 with NCA4. Is this the author's assessment of all the analyses of national adaptationactions writ large? If so, where are those citations? Fourth, why are the light blue arrows bi-directional? Fifth,what does the stakeholder thing with the hands mean and why is it the middle and who are these""stakeholders"" (another policy wonk buzzword)?

Allison,Crimmins,143528,Table,"28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",1,1319,,,,"Strongly suggest deleting this entire table. It is very confusing and not helpful to the reader. It introduces yetanother framework (actually one framework is the rows and another framework is the columns!). How theauthors determined what falls in each box is unclear. The caption says that the green text holds true for everysingle global location, which can not be true. Are the authors suggesting that these adaptation steps be takenand the red ones should not be taken? For instance, the authors are suggesting we should NOT restorewetlands? The black text says there is no US estimates, but the red and green text legend suggest these are on aglobal scale. Other bullet points seem to just be random words like ""sandbags"". While some bullets havemeaningless phrases like ""bolster human capital"" (what on earth is that?) There are no red or green text in thebottom section, and it is very unclear why the adaptive capacity row also has bullets that span both categories (Iguess these don't fit the framework? But there are no examples like this for exposure or sensitivity?). Even thecitations listed are limited, with almost all of the bullets coming from 2 or 3 sources primarily from 2009 and2010. Most importantly, this table takes up a large amount of room in the chapter without contributing anythingthe comprehension of the message and potentially introducing many errors and contentions about whether anadaptation action has higher benefits than costs in all places and all times. Suggest replacing with any number offigures that would enhance the readers understanding of the types of adaptation options out there (e.g. mapswith examples of actions taken around the US, graphs of cities or states with adaptation plans, the table from theEPA CIRA report that quantifies adaptation costs for infrastructure in the US, etc.)",We deleted the table due to space constraints

John,Fleming,143636,"WholeChapter","28. Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,,,,,"Adaptation efforts will ultimately be essential if we are to protect valuable infrastructure, homes, businesses,natural spaces, and individual livelihoods from climate change impacts. In order to deploy these efforts,substantial commitments to both capital investments and â€œmainstreamingâ€of adaptation strategies mustoccur. Such is already discussed in the Adaptation Response chapter. However, of great importance, but notdiscussed in the chapter, is who should be held responsible for deploying adaptation strategies. Considering theamount of investment that will be required, there will ultimately be disagreement over who should supplycapital. Should it be those who will be most impacted if they do not adapt, or should it be those who bear theresponsibility for worsening climate change and therefore created the need for adaptation? The issue withplacing the burden on the people most impacted is that those individuals may not have the means to effectivelyadapt. As discussed throughout the draft NCA, the people who will be most impacted are likely to be the mostdisadvantaged, including the poor, the elderly, and communities of color.It would be wrong to place the burden of adaptation on those most vulnerable to climate change. The burdenshould therefore be placed on those who are most responsible for bringing about climate change. A study thatanalyzed emissions primarily from companies that produce fossil fuels found that 63 percent of global industrialCO2 and methane emissions between 1751 and 2010 came from just 90 international entities. These entitiesincluded 56 crude oil and natural gas producers, 37 coal extractors, and 7 cement producers (Heede, R., Tracinganthropogenic carbon dioxide and methane emissions to fossil fuel and cement producers, 1854-2010, 122Climatic Change 229 (2014)). Based on historical data and climate modeling, emissions from these 90 fossil fuelentities have contributed an estimated 57 percent to the observed rise in atmospheric CO2, approximately 50percent to the rise in global mean surface temperature, and approximately 32 percent to global mean sea levelrise between 1751 and 2010 (Ekwurzel, B. et al., The rise in global atmospheric CO2, surface temperature, andsea level from emissions traced to major carbon producers, 144 Climatic Change 579 (2017)).

Near-TermAdaptation Needs andIncreased Resiliency",,1311,1311,3,4,"I think a clarification is needed here about how ""extreme"" conditions can become more common--it seems toimply the bell curve is simply flattening instead of shifting (and maybe also flattening--and this needs to bemade very clear to readers). NOAA's practice is to each decade update its normal to the past three decades, andthis has the effect of understating the intensity of the extreme for those aspects of society and the environment(e.g., city location with respect to sea level and mix of trees in the forest, respectively) that have time horizonslonger than three decades. If one looks at the Hansen et al. shifting bell curves, one get a good sense of this--looking at the current decade compared to the mid-20th century normal he used (actually 1951-80), we are nowexperiencing five and even six sigma events (in his case, summer average temperature anomaly for land areasin the NH)--those deviations imply one in several million likelihood--very rare and very impactful on ecosystems,etc. that were established in the mid-20th century (so after World War II when much of developed nationinfrastructure was built) and before (when most ecosystems became established). Indeed, Hansen et al. resultsindicate that warm extremes that were 1 in 1000 likelihood in the mid-20th century are now occurring 10% of thetime. I make this point here because I think it is important to, especialy here and in this context, to give someexplanation of what ""extreme"" means and how it is that communities can be having, for example, 100-yearstorms in successive years (basically, the statistical analysis for flooding was based on mid-20th century, and thebell curve has shifted such that it is now not at all unlikely to have years with successive or even multipleoccurrences of what was once rare--especially given that until at least a few years ago it was required practiceby civil engineers to only use past data in their analyses and building/bridge designs--not to look ahead.

This could be done e.g. by expanding the ""call out box"" on p.1349.

A statement on""emissions outsourcing"" would also be useful here to clarify that the impact of a given emissions strategy onclimate change mitigation is dependent on the resulting net reduction in emissions (e.g. Kanemoto et al. 2014,doi:10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2013.09.008).","Thank you for this comment, which was thoroghly considered by the author team.

The call-out box also mentions the range of policy options that have been discussedin the literature including standards, emission caps with trading, and emissions pricing.

The workshop resulted in three USGCRP white papers Social SciencePerspectives on Climate Change (USGCRP 2018, Part 1, 2 & 3 - upcoming), each on (1) social vulnerability toclimate change; (2) drivers of and responses to climate change; and (3) innovative methods and tools toevaluate coupled natural and human systems. Paper (2) discusses the underlying drivers of climate change,including demography, economy, politics, social stratification and inequality, technology, infrastructure, and landuse, and how these factors interact dynamically over space and time. In addition, the white papers collectivelyhighlight the importance to consider social, cultural, political, and economic factors and past decisions forunderstanding drivers and vulnerability of climate change, and the need for multi-scaled, multi-dimensionalapproaches and governance structures for mitigation and adaptation responses.

By omitting information aboutthe benefits of the RCP 2.6 pathway, the NCA is doing a disservice to the American public and decision-makerssince we should be striving for this pathway (or an even more ambitious 1.5C pathway).","We agree that the presentation of results for RCP2.6 would provide useful information for this chapter, however,the author team was limited to the availability of results in the literature.  Figure 29.2 is based on the findingsfrom the CIRA2.0 modeling project and Technical Report (EPA 2017b), which were developed to inform NCA4.Consistent with NCA4 guidance developed by the USGCRP Scenarios Working Group, CIRA2.0 focused on RCP8.5and RCP4.5 as the two forcing scenarios.

Twocommon and useful ways to do this are to (1) describe the emissions pathways for staying well below 2C and (2)describe the carbon budget needed for a reasonable probability of meeting this temperature target, includingboth the global carbon budget and U.S. carbon budget.

Carole,LeBlanc,143888,"WholeChapter","29. Mitigation:Avoiding and ReducingLong-Term Risks",,,,,,"Respectfully ask consideration of the following language: The Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle (PDCA) to MitigateClimate Change, by Dr. Phil Barnes, supports more and better use of the PDCA to reduce contributions to climatechange, including the materials used in production, how/what services are rendered and energy. The PDCA is aprocess tool used to guide managers in the implementation and maintenance of a management system forchange and continual improvement. Its history dates back to the 1940s and the development of theInternational Organization for Standardization (ISO) series of quality standards, ISO 9000. In 1993, the U.S.Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) initiated the Code of Environmental Management Principles, which usedthe PDCA for continual environmental management improvement. In 1996, the first ISO EnvironmentalManagement System (EMS) standard was published as ISO 14001 EMS and included the PDCA; an EMS callsfor an organization to identify environmental aspects (causes) and impacts (effects) and plans made to managethem (e.g., address risks) accordingly. Since that time, a number of ISO climate change standards have beenpromulgated, dealing primarily with GHG inventories and emissions. To date, there are over 1.3 millionorganizations that have certified to the ISO quality and EMS standards with many integrating the twomanagement systems. The key to successfully using the PDCA as a climate change tool is to ensure thatmanagers incorporate the PDCA continual improvement cycle into the performance culture of the organization.","We note that the Plan-Do-Check-Act Cycle is less relevant to the focus of this chapter, as no managementsystems are being discussed or implemented, so the specific requested change has not been made to thechapter text. However, we note that iterative risk management is related to the PDCA concept. In coordinationwith Ch 28: Adaptation, we have added text describing iterative risk management, a strategy in which initialactions are modified over time as learning occurs and note that chapter focuses primarily on the first stage of theiterative process in which risks and vulnerabilities are identified."

Mitigation:Avoiding and ReducingLong-Term Risks",,1359,1359,38,39,"This is a quite limited view about CDR, there being a number of approaches that might be less expensive. Thereal challenge is really the scaling up of CDR, especially when emissions are not brought way down. So, whilemitigation can likely to a lot at reasonable cost, as its cost rises as the easy changes are made, CDR is likely to bea better option. Thus, I really think the framing has to be a bit different here, indicating that all play together andresearch is needed on all, and that then the least expensive option may change as one goes from efficiency tosubstitution of renewables to use of biofuels and CDR. I think a more integrated perspective is needed in thisparagraph, especially in that there will be the need for negative emissions to meet the temeprature targets asvirtually all emissions pathways now envisioned will lead to significant temperature overshoots. Once the write-up is fixed here, then the front of the chapter needs to reflect the more integrated view of approaches I'm urginghere.","We have modified the text to incorporate the point that CDR costs vary across different measures, and that areestimated to be currently expensive at scale.

Yes, there are differences, but inmost situations they tend to fall within the range of natural variations, and in virtually all cases the remainingdifferences are far, far less than the perturbation that exists without undertaking climate interventions. Inaddition, most of the studies done are for very large interventions (trying to offset the doubling or quadrupling ofthe CO2 concentration instead of seeking to offset what is left given a good go at mitigation and even CDR). Tosuggest one would not be better off with climate intervention is in my view irresponsible and very misleading(like saying because one can't fix the scratch on one's arm, there is no basis for applying a tourniquet to staunchthe flow from an artery; and this comment similarly applies on the ocean acidification issue--does one not doanything if one can't do everything? Again, what needs to be done is to consider an integrated approach to usingall the potential tools available and not be acting as if the question is if any one can do what needs to be donealone (mitigation clearly is not enough, for example, so why should the other options be considered aloneeither?).","After revisiting the literature, we disagree with the assertion that it does not show that regional effects of SRMdiffer from those resulting from mitigation via emissions reduction. This is true not only in SRM-only scenarios,but also in those in which smaller amounts of SRM are combined with mitigation (see e.g. Tilmes et al.,2016, Geophysical Research Letters, 43, 8222-8229). This is true to greater extent for some variables(precipitation, aridity) than for others (temperature extremes). We also disagree that this text suggeststhat climate intervention would make things worse off than without intervention. The comparison is betweenclimate intervention and emissions mitigation. Nonetheless we have decided that it is more important to makethe broader point here that SRM effects on precipitation and other outcomes are more uncertain than those ontemperature, rather than focusing on the comparison of effects of mitigation vs SRM.

The global average temperaturereally needs to be brought back down to less than 0.5 C, and even that would likely not keep sea level rise withina range that would not require very substantial impacts to most of the world's coastal cities. The Paris Accordcan be considered a start, but its goal is a political one and not scientifically based.","In response to this comment, we have inserted the following statement where the 2C objective is mentioned:""These targets were developed with the goal of avoiding the most severe climate impacts; however, theyshould not be viewed as thresholds below which there are zero risks and above which numerous tipping pointsare suddenly triggered."""

It would be just as unreasonable to say now that everyone might stop mitigation sowhy even give it a try. Given it is important to the world and is relatively easily done, it would seem far better forthe frog to jump out of the pot even though there is of course the chance that someone might put the frog backin the pot. The world has, perhaps to a lot of people's surprise, has kept from having an all-out nuclear war,showing that it can show some degree of wisdom. Given the adverse consequences of climate change withoutSRM, the situation sure looks pretty bleak  given that staying below 1.5 C likely requires ending global fossil fueluse in a decade or two, and this is without considering the warming effect of losing the sulfate cooling offset.This particular sentence I think should simply be deleted, or rephrased to say that SRM can provide an earlytime warming offset, and the phasing out of it could then be accomplished by combined mitigation and CDR--treat the overall issue with an integrated response, not thinking of the approaches being singly applied--it is fartoo late for such thinking.","We believe it is important to reflect the literature on risks of sudden cessation of SRM, leading to rapid climatechange. We have modified the text however to indicate that this refers specifically to ""sudden"" cessation of""large-scale"" SRM, and that a gradual phaseout of SRM would not have the same effect."
Michael,MacCracken,144695,Text Region,"29. Mitigation:Avoiding and ReducingLong-Term Risks",,1359,1359,31,33,"This is really a very narrow way of thinking about these approaches. Various of the approaches couldconceptually be applied regionally to moderate the projected increase in tropical cyclone intensity, to moderateamplified Arctic warming, to make up for loss of the sulfate cooling offset, to moderate increases in watertemperature over sensitve areas like the Great Barrier Reef, to moderate loss of ice from the ice sheets, etc.--given how little funded study there has been, we just do not know, but there quite possibly are a number ofspecial types of activities that might be pursued. And, given that variations in orbital parameters involvingchanges in the amount of radiation at various latitudes by several percent are apparently what drove (withfeedbacks) the growth and decay of ice sheets for glacial-interglacial cycling, that human stimulated changes ofa few percent, so comparable to what major volcanic eruptions do, would seem worth investigating. Were bychance Nature to cause the eruption of volcanic erutpions over a period of time, I don't know of any studiessuggesting that such an event would not be welcomed to limit the cooling, so what is it that so summarily isdismissing the potential stepping in of humans to intentionally do this in light of the quite dismaying situationthat we are in (which this chapter does not really seem to highlight very well)? I just think the overallpresentation on this issue (so in this section) is totally inadequate in laying out the dilemma that we face.Indeed, climate intervention is not perfect, but that is not the issue to be considered. What needs to beconsidered is if it makes more sense to be doing mitigation plus CDR and adaptation with or without a roleplayed by global and/or regional SRM.One can hope that every other approach is adequate and so SRM is notneeded, but this is not the way that things look now if one wants to keep the temperature increase below theParis objectives and then come back quickly, as is essential, to below 0.5 C. And this section simply does not laythat out.","We agree that describing climate intervention as aimed solely at moderating global average temperature isoverly narrow, and have added or modified text in several places to indicate the possibility of other aims (the firstsentence of the section, the fourth sentence of the revised text which defines SRM, and the discussion ofpros/cons of SRM with an added reference). More generally, we have indicated in the first sentence that themain treatment of this issue is in the Climate Science Special Report, to which the reader can refer for additionaldiscussion.

By ‰ÛÏweather patterns‰Ûthe implication is synoptic scale - or thousandsof kilometer. No doubt there are local land-use impacts on weather and climate, but the numbers that are givenfor land-use changes in the text (e.g., Fig 5.2) are too small to have a significant influence on patterns of thatscale. For example, numbers in the thousands of square miles of change per 40 years are given in Fig 5.2 on p194, for which the total of all regions is only about 1% of the CONUS U.S. land area.","Figure 5.2 shows the net change in land cover, not land use. Furthermore, net change represents only a fractionof the total land cover change  (gross change). The figure shows the annualized rate of change. The authorsagree that the annualized rate of change is relatively small and likeley not a significant driver of weather andclimate change. However, when considered over sufficiently long temporal periods their cumulative effect canhave profound consequences and significantly alter regional to global climate."

In fact, the same amount of shortwave solar energy from the sun thatis not immediately scattered or reflected must necessarily be re-radiated into space by the earth as thermalradiation (less a miniscule fraction stored on earth as it warms - maybe that is what it was intended to show).Else, the temperature of the earth would rise very extremely rapidly.See if you think a professional figure something similar to my poor, hasty PowerPoint efforts sent separatelymight be a little closer.  The sum of the widths of the outgoing arrows equals the width of the incoming solararrow.  I show that it is re-radiated from the atmosphere at a lower level causing near-surface warming.

Michael,MacCracken,144705,Text Region,"Appendix 5: FrequentlyAsked Questions",,1447,1447,1,4,"Actually,with respect to the question and point 1, what I think is important is that the change in global averagetemperature is quite consistent with the types of changes that have occurred in the past when one considers theroles of the various natural and human-induced forcing factors. It is actually the similarity of the magnitude ofthe responses that raises the concerns--did the past show no or only a small response to changes in forcingscomparable to ones that humans are responsible for, one might well not be so concerned. But what pasttemperature changes show is that large changes can result from relatively small changes in forcing, and that iswhat really is concerning. So, I think the first part of this question is answered incorrectly--and the question isposed incorrectly. The second point is indeed the case. Because of the need to change the first point, some ofthe following text needs revision.","Thank your for the comment. We understand the point you are making, however we want to emphasize thatthe current period of warming is being driven by human emissions, which is captured in the first part of theanswer.

Fine to say climate didchange due to natural forcings--what is really critical here is to say that past climate change was not just randombouncing around--the changes happened for reasons involving changes in forcing.

Michael,MacCracken,144712,Text Region,"Appendix 5: FrequentlyAsked Questions",,1450,1450,10,13,"While the scientific community did not come to consensus on this, there certainly were prominent individualscientists suggesting that the world might go into a cooling phase, and doing so for a couple of reasons. First, thefirst ocean sediment core indicated that 90% of the time it was colder than present and the average glacial cyclelasted about 100,000 years, so with the Holocene being about 10,000 years old, we were possibly due to headinto a glacial period; more detailed analyses of the sediment cores indicate that the length of interglacials canvary from a few thousand to perhaps 40,000 years and our present situation is most like the orbital situation thatled to the 40,000 year duration. Second, during the 1960s there was a continuation of the buildup of troposphericaerosols that resulted from going to tall stacks to emit the gases from coal-fired power plants and it was thoughtthe resulting cooling influence would be larger than the long-term CO2 warming influence because it was onlybeginning to be understood that the persistence time of at least some of the CO2 perturbation is many millenniarather than the several year lifetime of a particular CO2 molecule (which was a result that emerged in the 1960swhen considering the lifetime of radioactive C-14 from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests. Third, the earlysatellite derived trends of wintertime snow cover showed a strong positive change--it turned out this was due tojust occasiaonal, thin snow cover over the Tibetan Plateau, and so with a longer record the trend towardincreasing snow cover went away. But there were strong proponents on both sides of the issue. The subsequenttext seems to capture this pretty well.","Thank you for the comment. You are certainly right that there was discussion of possible explanation for coolingphases early on the development of the climate community.

For example, there appears to be no practical way for mitigationto keep the temperature to 1.5 C, which will lead to impacts such as ongoing sea level rise that adaptationcannot possibly cope with except at very, very high cost. The global average temperature increase really needsto be below 0.5 C as rapidly as posssible (see Hansen et al paper on consequences of being over this value--given climate sensitivity from paleoclimate being of order 15-20 meters per degree at equilibrium). And there isno way mitigation and adaptation can do this. CDR can, likely over many decades, though there are efforts tofind ways to get to negative emissions faster--but aggressive mitigation is also required. The notion is that onemight use SRM to do it early and then phase it out as CDR takes over, so a much smaller role for SRM (global, orperhaps just regional) than is covered in most ot the papers to date that are very exploratory as virtually noresearch is being funded. Basically, I think the position taken in this opening statement is not technically correctand does not even cover what is being suggested, which is a coprehensive approach using all possible andneeded approaches. We are too far along to do anything less.","Thank you for the comment. This question is posed to introduce people to the idea of geoengineering, not toadvocate the use of geoengeering alone. We have edited the response to incorporate some of your suggestions,such as complimenting geoengineering with adaptation and mitigation and noting that much of thegeoengineering research is still in the developmental phase. We cannot, however, advocate for the use of anyparticular geoengineering method or even the we need to use geoengieering as that would be policyperscriptive."

(1) It is widely agreed that the cost would likely be far less than mitigation(once past thelowest hanging fruit) and CDR (though some researchers are working on this). One of the concerns is that it is solow cost that mitigation might not be pursued, which would be disatroous as there are limits to how much SRMcan be done without creating other serious issues and a very extended commitment. (2) There are limits inunderstanding as virtually no research has gone on into it, but I'd suggest that we should have more confidencein models simulations for SRM, which keeps the climate near to what we know and experience, than for ongoingGHG driven climate change, where the climate is headed to conditions for which we have no experience--theuncertainty situation is backwards compared to the text. (3) Indeed SRM is not perfect but the question iswhether one would be better off with mitigation plus CDR and SRM or with mitigation without CDR and/or SRM. Idon't know anyone (wel, except those with mirror-based solar systems) would would be upset if there justhappened to be an ongoing series of mnor volcanic eruptions going on to keep the temperatures a bit coolerthan they otherwise would be--yet if this were done by humans, there is all this fear of unintendedconsequences.

Roughly 600-900 Gigatons of CO2 have been added to the air sincethe Industrial Revolution (IR), thus needing 10 million trees to remove it all in 1 year, or 1 million in 10 years (AlGore‰Ûas timetable) or 0.3 million in 30 years (John Doerr‰Ûas timetable).

Even if all other reduction schemes fail, the trees will remove all postIndustrial Revolution CO2 to the present, can continue to run as a stopgap to remove future global annualcontributions, & can be switched off when done.A primary aim of this proposal is to supplant the many lines of attacking the CO2 problem with an alternativeapproach - it does not require or rely upon the success of any other CO2 reduction scheme, nor does it deemlikely that remaining fossil fuel will go undeveloped & that developing nations will curtail their developmentprograms. This proposal‰Ûas alternative approach is that it recommends a single, relatively simple, direct &failsafe method of CO2 removal regardless of source or quantity, thereby providing countries the time to makethe changes to renewable/sustainable technologies & meet the UN IPCC goals without damaging theireconomies.Detail: A specific approach to implement the project has been submitted as a proposal to  the MIT Center forCollective Intelligence Climate CoLab, titled ‰ÛÏEnd Global Warming & Climate Change Now‰Ûat","We appreciate this comment; however, revising the report to address this comment is outside the scope of thedocument.

Political leaders whoadvocate unwarranted taxes and regulations on fossil fuels will be seen as fools or knaves. Nature converts CO2to limestone.Climate change may or may not be occurring, but is NOT caused by human fossil fuels use. Temperature recordsrelied upon by researchers are corrupt for many reasons. They used weak proxies for periods prior to 1850.Actual temperature readings were tampered with. Evidence such as ice cores suffer poor chain-of-custody, andwere altered by ambient conditions.Temperature changes cause changes in ambient CO2; not vice versa. Temperature caused by naturala forcescause changes in CO2. since 95% of CO2 air emissions are emitted by rotting vegetation, of course suchen=missions will be higher at higher temperatures.There is no empirical evidence that fossil fuels use affects climate. Likely and well-documented causes includesunspot cycles, earth/sun orbital changes, cosmic ray effects on clouds and tectonic plate activity. The furtherpoint here is that earth naturally recycles all carbon dioxide.Fossil fuels emit only 3% of total CO2 emissions. 95% comes from rotting vegetation and other sources. All theambient CO2 in the atmosphere is promptly converted in the oceans to calcite (limestone) and other carbonates,mostly through biological paths. CO2 + CaO => CaCO3 (exothermic). The conversion rate increases withincreasing CO2 partial pressure. A dynamic equilibrium-seeking mechanism.The organisms that convert dissolved CO2 to calcite all have short lifespans. At the most basic level, they includecyanobacteria and sea butterflies. Higher levels include corals, bivalves and other crustaceans. An acre ofoysters or mussels can create 100 tons of calcite in a single season.99.84% of all carbon on earth is already sequestered as sediments in earth's crust. The lithosphere is a massivehungry carbon sink that converts ambient CO2 to carbonate almost as soon as it is emitted.The Paris Treaty is now estimated to cost up to to $100 trillion -- $13,333 per human being. Nearly two-thirds ofhumanity's cumulative savings over history. And will not affect climate at all.A modern coal power plant emits few air effluents except water vapor and carbon dioxide.

Jan,"Dash, PhD",141895,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"Comments on the NCA-4 Whole Document by Richard McNider and John Christy, The University of Alabama inHuntsville.In the last 25 years climate science assessment documents from the IPCC to the Present NCA-4 have devolvedfrom a rational accounting of knowns and unknowns to a one-sided epistle for climate action. This has comeabout as physical climate scientists with skeptical views have been systematically removed or marginalized inthe assessment process. Additionally, physical climate scientists have been replaced bysocial/ecological/chemical scientists who are ascribing impacts without understanding that the impacts theyattribute to GHG climate change are not a signal of GHG climate change. The present system has produced anecho chamber with little curiosity to address the basic fundamental signals of climate change that areinconsistent with theory and models.The most disturbing aspect of the NCA-4 is the certainty expressed throughout the document. Most everyonewho has dealt with the complex physical climate system directly understands that known and unknowninteractions produce large uncertainty in both near-term and long-term climate forecasts.  There seems to be nocuriosity for addressing aspects of the climate system that models consistently fail in verification.Red Team: A solution to bring back more diverse views into the assessment process is to form ‰ÛÏRedTeams‰Ûthat will specifically look for failures, problems or unresolved issues with the assessment. Thefindings of the Red Team could be refuted by the regular assessment team. The problem that came about fromthe IPCC process was the belief that action would be taken only based on consensus. Then the make-up of theIPCC was developed to ensure that the majority were non-skeptical and no minority views were everypublished. In the Red Team process if issues are unresolved then the Red Team position would be published as aminority opinion as part of the Final Assessment Document. There is also a need to fund Red Team Science sincethe current peer review process ensures that skeptical proposals are seldom accepted by a majority based peerreview process.Lack of Deep Atmospheric Warming: While the NCA-4 contains a litany of weather phenomena and impacts thatare linked to climate change, the fundamental fact remains that actual global warming is proceeding at a pacewell below the model projections that have been made by the climate change community over the last threedecades.  For all the concerns about changes listed in the assessment,  the basic tenet of GHG climate change as","We disagree on almost all of the diverse statements made in this comment.First, there was no bias at all in the author selection process. The authors were selected after an open process fornominations (through a Federal Register announcement). This was the case for both NCA4 Volume 1 andVolume II. The selection of the authors by the Federal Steering Committee considered a variety of criteria, themost important of which were the accomplishments of the prospective authors and their likelihood for accuratelyassessing the state of understanding of the changes in climate and resulting impacts for the chapters they wereselected for as an author.Early in the commentary, there was also mention that “physical climate scientists have been replaced bysocial/ecological/chemical scientists”. That is not true of NCA4 Volume 1 on the science of climate change or theassociated chapter 2 in Volume II. However, it is important that the impacts analyses in much of Volume II trulyreflect the experts in impacts, and those often come other disciplines. However, we have also maintained stronginteractions between the physical scientists and the impacts analyses to ensure that the connections of theimpacts to climate are carefully accounted for in the assessment.It should be noted that Chapter 2 in Volume II is a short summary of findings from the now published Volume 1.Uncertainties of the science are extensively discussed in Volume 1.It is important to recognize that volume II builds on Volume 1 and does not replace it. Volume 1 does discuss theissues raised by the reviewers related to the science of climate change, including the concerns about models andassociated uncertainties (for example, note that  for the first time in an assessment a weighting was applied tothe models in NCA4 based on how well they represented observations that has not been found in any previousassessment – see Chapter 4 and Appendix B of NCA4 Volume 1). We also refer the reviewers to the TraceableAccounts, which describe in greater detail than is possible – or intended – for the narrative text just how “certain”the authors are in a given conclusion – and why / how they came to that level of certainty in a given conclusion.Traceable Accounts are found for any key finding made in both Volume 1 and Volume II.Comments about models overestimating the observed trends in globally-averaged temperature primarily relateto the slowdown in the rate of temperature increase that occurred between about 2000-2013. The slowdown intemperature change during the 2000- 2013 time period and why that is not fully represented in the modelingstudies is extensively discussed in NCA4 Volume 1, especially in Chapter 1 but is also discussed in later chapters."

Christy, Alabama State Climatologist andRichard McNider,The University of Alabama in HuntsvilleThis comment is narrowly focused on the issue of using regional climate model projections demonstrating thattheir use in NA4 fails the data-quality requirement.  Due to our extensive agricultural research on climatevariations and trends in Alabama we have studied the ‰ÛÏfitness for purpose‰Ûof the IPCC AR5 CMIP-5climate models regarding their applicability to agricultural productivity in the 21st century in our region.We performed simple but tedious analyses on the climate model output over the past century (and more) todetermine the quality of the model simulations when compared with observations.  These results werepublished in the American Meteorological Society‰Ûas Journal of Applied Meteorology and Climatology(Christy and McNider, 2016).    One key result is given in Fig. 12 and emailed as part of this response (withannotations for clarity).We examined 76 simulations for 1895 to 2013 from the CMIP-5 models for the state of Alabama as a test oftheir utility.  [Though these runs utilized the rcp8.5 forcing, the period examined (1895-2013) had commonforcing in all of the rcp scenarios.]   As can be seen, the output for model trends indicated all models producedvery positive temperature trends (red) when in fact the observed trend was negative (-0.09 å¡C decade-1 andvirtually identical between the time series constructed by us in this paper and that of NCEI/NOAA).  Thus, 100percent of the models were in error on the most basic of parameters ‰ÛÒ the sign of the temperature trend.Additionally, the great majority of simulations were in error on the trend in precipitation (blue) over the period.Our conclusion stated, ‰ÛÏ‰Û_ CMIP-5 climate model runs are examined for Alabama and indicate no skill atreplicating long-term temperature and precipitation changes since 1895‰Û(emphasis added).  Indeed theskill level was actually negative.  This result is generally true for the Southeastern US as a whole.We thus demonstrated that all of the models failed a simple statistical validation test of a critical parameter‰ÛÒ surface temperature.  As such, NA4 has no scientifically-defensible basis to go forward and use suchsimulations to project future climate changes and impacts from those changes.  These models have not passeda simple validation exercise which we have published in the peer-reviewed literature.","While we agree that the global CMIP5 models largely do not represent the observed temperature changes inAlabama and various parts of the Southeast (the lack of warming in parts of that region over the last centuryrelative to the extensive warming of most other parts of the United States are discussed in Chapter 6 of NCA4Volume 1), a major result from Volume 1 was high resolution downscaled evaluations of the regional climatechanges that combine model results with observational data. There has been discussion in the sciencecommunity of whether there are processes not being considered in the global models (e.g., the deforestation ofthe southeast in the 19th century followed by the reforestation in the 20th century), but the exact causes of thelack of warming in the Alabama region remain uncertain. The downscaled analyses provide an enhancedevaluation of the past and projected future changes for the authors to use in the regional analyses in Volume 2.Since they have a strong tie back to the observations at the local scale, there is more confidence in thoseanalyses relative to just using the results from the global models at the local scales for some regions. We referthe authors of this comment to the discussion of the downscaled products that can be found in Chapter 4 ofVolume 1."

Nicholas,Rajkovich,141981,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"As this is the fourth NCA it would be fitting to include a review of predictions from previous reports to see howwell or badly they played out. The 1st NCA in 2000 predicted (p. 17) that the US would warm between 0.3 and0.9 oF per decade. It‰Ûas now nearly two decades later. GISS data for the US is available athttps://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs/. Regressing the data from 1997 to 2007 on a time trend yields awarming rate of 0.18 oF per decade which is well below the bottom end of your predicted range. If you cut outthe 1998 El Nino and just use the 2000-2017 data the rate is only 0.27 oF per decade, still below the low end ofyour predicted range, even with a big El Nino spike at the end.Speaking of the El Nino, in several places you say that US average temperatures have risen by 1.2 oF ‰ÛÏoverthe last few decades.‰Û(It is unclear what the start and end dates are) It is dishonest not to mention the roleof the El Nino spike. This report was drafted with data ending in 2016. The GISS US temperature in 2014 justprior to the El Nino was 0.32 oF and in 2016 it was 1.66 oF , a jump of 1.34 oF, which means that the entireincrease you are referring to happened in the last 24 months as a result of the El Nino at the end of the sample.These examples point to a pattern of  one-sidedness that pervades the document. In the sections I read I sawno attempt to give the reader a balanced understanding of major systemic uncertainties or model failings. Thedocument maintains a promotional tone throughout for a view of climate change as a severe unmitigatedcatastrophe based on model projections which are nowhere acknowledged to have a history of overstatingwarming trends. The failure of the catastrophes outlined in NCA-1 to materialize doesn‰Ûat seem to havegiven the authors of NCA-4 the least pause.Picking up on the extraordinary over-prediction from NCA-1, ample recent evidence has shown that measuredclimate sensitivity is well below CMIP3 and CMIP5 model parameterizations. Dayaratna et al. (2017) re-ran theEPA‰Ûas Social Cost of Carbon models using the Lewis and Curry (2015) ECS estimate and the SCC fell by 40-80% depending on the model. In the only Integrated Assessment Model that allows for gains from moderatewarming (FUND), there is a 40% chance that the Social Cost of Carbon globally will be negative through 2050.Overall the document has a biased and one-sided tone. I can only assume that the authoring team was filteredahead of time to include proponents of one side, and any balancing material was carefully excluded. As such thisdocument lacks the quality necessary to inform public policymaking.Refs: Dayaratna, Kevin, Ross McKitrick and David Kreutzer (2016) Empirically-Constrained Climate Sensitivity","We disagree with the statements made in this comment or its suggestions for additional discussion for a varietyof reasons. First, regarding the first paragraph, the assessments are not making predictions, they are projectionsthat depend on various factors, including  the emissions assumptions made about the future. Secondly theanalyses of climate change are made on 30-year time scales not 10-year time scales; it is important to actuallycapture the time scales of climate (using the definition of the World Meteorological Organization). Third, byfocusing in on the period since 2000, the author of the comment is really referring to the slow down period, whichis discussed extensively in Chapter 1 of NCA4 Volume 1 – there we also explain why the models would not beexpected to capture the trend for that shorter period. Fourth, the understanding of the science does evolve overtime -- there is no need to evaluate the findings of this assessment relative to prior NCAs.Regarding paragraph 2 of the comment, there is extensive discussion of the effects of ENSO in NCA4 volume 1.The analyses in Chapter 2 use trends over 30 year periods or longer (to capture climate timescales as mentionedabove) where the effect of specific El Nino events are much more limited (not to mention that 2017, a neutral toLa Nina year, was found by the same NASA analyses to be the 2nd warmest year on record). So our analyses arerepresentative of long term trends and are not tied to years when there was a particular ENSO event.All peer-reviewed findings for climate sensitivity were considered in this assessment, including the full range ofanalyses of the climate sensitivity, not just those preferred by this reviewer (see NCA4 Volume 1 for more detailon climate sensitivity). The references preferred by the reviewer have been shown by other papers to havemajor limitations and their findings have been overtaken by other recent references. These are discussed inNCA4 Volume 1."

Erica,Brown,142029,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"Summary comments for the NCA4 Volume II as a whole:1. The document is far, far too massive, relative to it's useful information content.This is a general, and worsening, problem with large scale climate assessments which increasingly take a""kitchen sink"" approach--throw everything and anything considered relevant in and let the reader sort out theresulting mess.  More specifically: (1) it repeats huge volumes of information, both within the NCA4 itself, and asgiven in IPCC Assessment Reports, (2) it is exceedingly wordy at the expense of concise and usefulsummaries/presentations of relevant, existing data and data sources, and (3) it makes many interpretive and/orjudgmental statements and conclusions based on data that are not in fact presented, and/or which it is unclearwhether the authors of the cited works themselves actually concluded.These issues get to the heart of the question of what purpose NCA reports are designed to serve, and to whatgroups of potential readers.  Ostensibly, scientists are the target group, but the document's structure,statements and tone indicate rather that it's designed for legislators and others interested in policy more thanscience.  Scientific writing style prioritizes brevity, coherence and readability--criteria which this report failscompletely on.  At 1383 pages (without appendices), it's unlikely that anyone will in fact read this entiredocument carefully--but they might well read a much shorter and more cogent document.  The amount of bothcontent and copy editing needed in this document is gargantuan.Even more specifically, given that the IPCC Assessments emphasize the global scale, AND that the purview ofthe NCA process is for the United States only, it is not necessary to repeat the huge volume of global scaleanalyses that are presented.  This material is fully ad nauseum.Obviously, it is far too late in the process to make these kinds of major structural overhauls, which points out theinadequacy of placing the public comment period at the end of the process.2.  There are basically four separate introductory chapters, and collectively they are largely repetitions of IPCCAR5, and/or NCA4 Volume 1 material, with a strong focus on the global, not United States scale.  If this materialis to be included at all, it should be placed in an appendix.Global scale climatic dynamics, and their drivers, are not identical to the dynamics and relevant drivers operatingat smaller spatio-temporal scales.  At the latter scales, local and regional processes take on increasingimportance--drivers such as land cover change, tropospheric ozone, aerosols and black carbon, irrigation areas","On the first point regarding length, scope and digestibility, the report is a result of extensive consultation acrossthe government and with the general public.  Indeed, a public call for input on a draft Table of Contents, coupledwith agency priorities (it is a Federal report) resulted in the Table of Contents that we have.  Recognizing thedesire to keep such assessment reports as concise as possible,s truct page limits were imposed on the authors: 6pages for the National-level Topic Chapters and 20-pages for the Regional chapters.  Naturally, the inclusion ofreferences in some cases almost doubles this length.  Moreover, as it relates to the national vs global scope, infact the report - outside Chapter 2, which sumamrizes the clmate science (albeit still with a focus on the U.S.) -focuses squarely and exclusively on the U.S.  ///  On the second point regarding ""four introductory chapters"" andthe need to focus at more local scales, we have moved the ""Climate Science Findings"" from the very front of thereport to simply be the Exeuctive Summary of the Chapter 2.

William,Langbo,142383,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"My overall impression of this report is that it is coming along, but there is great disparity between the chapters interms of their progress. Some chapters seem like they are in a final draft already (e.g. Tribal), some just needsome polishing (e.g. International), some have pretty substantial issues and several pages to cut (e.g.adaptation), and some needs pretty major overhauls (e.g. health, introduction). It is not clear that each chapterdid the same level or rigor of literature review and assessment.Furthermore, I found many of the key messages to be exceptionally boring and generic. Many said little morethan 'climate change affects my topic' and 'adaptation would be good'. The ""risk framing"" discussed in theintroduction was not observed in the key messages and there were very few quantitative statements. Very fewkey messages were even different from NCA3, which only begs the question why this report is needed (I believeit is needed, but others won't, and you could be making your case stronger for the need for these assessments!)Very few key messages made good talking points or newsworthy items. It is unclear why you needed experts towrite them, when any undergraduate could have written 'climate change affects my topic'. Many were long andwordy, but also nothingburgers.The traceable accounts sections of each chapter really need to be reviewed- maybe by one review editor or oneperson who looks across all the chapters. These varied wildly- sometimes each TA varied wildly within achapter. These felt like after-thoughts and were often riddled with mistakes (e.g. listing a high confidence in thekey message only to say there was medium confidence in the Description of Confidence and Likelihood sectionlater within the same TA). Some were missing opening paragraphs, some had new references not in the chapter,some had no references, etc. And there needs to be an eye for consistent use of these rankings: what is mediumconfidence in one chapter needs to be medium confidence in another. This is hard, as different authors will havedifferent levels of risk aversion, but some independent review of these would make the entire report stronger.One of the most disappointing elements of this report was its lack of compelling figures. Perhaps these are still inthe works, but I saw many more 'adapted from"" or ""directly cited"" figures than new figures. Since these tend tobe shared on social media and used in presentations, much more emphasis is needed on creating new,compelling figures than on recycling old ones. Some chapters had zero or only 1 figure, making that figure evenmore important.Some chapters need a strong review editing as well. For example, the health chapter had a number of citations","This comment contains several elements: (1) The consistency in quality across chapters has been greatlyimproved since the release of the Third Order Draft for public comment.  Some chapters (e.g., Overview,Ecosystems) have undergone substantial re-writes, while others (e.g., Adaptation) have significantly pared backtheir length.  (2) Additional guidance was provided by NCA leadership to authors to help them refine KeyMessages and we feel significant advances have been made in the Fourth Order Draft to include efficient,compelling, clear, and accurate Key Messages. (3) We agree that the quality of the Traceable Accounts (TAs)varied significantly across chapters in the public comment draft, so we focused a lot of attention and guidance ondirecting authors to pay particular attention to the TA guidance provided at the beginning of the process aschapter teams sought to improve them.  As a result, the TAs are now much more consistent within and acrosschapters in describing the level of confidence in given findings, describing the evidence base, and identifyingmajor uncertainties. (4) A significant amount of effort has gone in to creating and improving graphics since therelease of the Third Order Draft for public comment, including in the Overview.  (5) Copyediting and proofreadingwill continue with each successive draft to ensure that references cited in the text exist in the reference list at theend of the chapter and vice versa.  (6) We understand that the length of the reportr is daunting; page limits weregiven to author teams in an effort to constrain the length.  A key challenge of an assessment of this nature iscovering topics that are of importance to the 13 USGCRP agencies, the general public, decisionmakers, and thescientific community.  Coupling fulfillment of those diverse needs with the addressing of multiple rounds ofreviews makes an overall concise report quite challenging, though we have sought to pare back text andeliminate redundancy wherever possible.

Introduction and Plain Language SummaryThe draft fourth ‰ÛÏNational Assessment‰Û(‰ÛÏNA4‰Û) of climate change impacts is systematicallyflawed and requires a complete revision.NA4 uses a flawed ensemble of models that dramatically overforecast warming of the lower troposphere, witheven larger errors in the upper tropical troposphere. The model ensemble also could not accommodate the‰ÛÏpause‰Ûor ‰ÛÏslowdown‰Ûin warming between the two large El NiníÄos of 1997-8 and 2015-6. Thedistribution of warming rates within the CMIP5 ensemble is not a true indication of a statistical range ofprospective warming, as it is a collection of systematic errors. Despite a glib statement about this Assessmentfulfilling the terms of the federal Data Quality Act, that is fatuous. The use of systematically failing models doesnot fulfill the ‰ÛÏmaximizing the quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information‰Ûprovision of theAct.Institutional memory relating to the production of previous assessments is strong, and the process itself is long,as the first drafts of this version were written in the middle of the second Obama Administration.  They werewritten largely by the same team that wrote the 2014 Assessment, which NOAA advertised, at its release, was‰ÛÏa key deliverable of President Obama‰Ûas Climate Action Plan.‰ÛThe first (2000) Assessment usedthe two most extreme models of the 14 considered for temperature and precipitation. In my review I appliedthem to 10-year running means of lower-48 temperatures and the residual error was larger than the error of theraw data itself!  The historical lineage of the fourth Assessment has all but guaranteed an alarming report,regardless of reality.USGCRP should produce a reset Assessment, relying on a model or models that work in four dimensions for","We disagree on almost all of the diverse statements made in this comment.

First of all, the reviewer would haverealized that the discussion of past changes in climate are entirely based on observations, that the models werethen evaluated relative to those observations throughout the assessment, and that the analyses of futurechanges were analyzed further than prior assessments by weighting the models relative to how well theyrepresent observations.Then, regarding the authors, there is actually only a small overlap between authors in NCA3 and those in NCA4 (7out of the 51 authors of NCA4 Volume I were authors of the science sections for NCA3). There was no bias at allin the author selection process. The authors were selected after an open process for nominations (through aFederal Register announcement). This was the case for both NCA4 Volume 1 and Volume II. The selection of theauthors by the Federal Steering Committee considered a variety of criteria, the most important of which werethe accomplishments of the prospective authors and their expertise, and their likelihood for accurately assessingthe state of understanding of the changes in climate and resulting impacts for the chapters they were selectedfor as an author.Most of the commentary relates to the state of models used for the future projections. First, it should be notedthat Chapter 2 in Volume II is a short summary of findings from the now published Volume 1. Uncertainties ofthe science are extensively discussed in Volume 1.It is important to recognize that volume II builds on Volume 1 and does not replace it. Volume 1 does discuss theissues raised by the reviewers related to the science of climate change, including the concerns about models andassociated uncertainties (for example, note that for the first time in an assessment a weighting was applied tothe models in NCA4 based on how well they represented observations that has not been found in any previousassessment – see Chapter 4 and Appendix B of NCA4 Volume 1).Comments about models overestimating the observed trends in globally-averaged temperature primarily relateto the slowdown in the rate of temperature increase that occurred between about 2000-2013. Figure 1 in thecommentary is a distorted look at the comparison of temperature with observations, largely because it only"

Other areas where research on impacts toarchaeological sites can impact the effectiveness of the assessment are economics.

The assessment looks to historical data on climate change,but archaeologists also collect data on the interaction of human cultures with the environment in the UnitedStates over 14,000 years and these data can be useful in adaptation and mitigation planning.SHA requests the editors to consider inclusion of an archaeologist in each regional chapter to contribute to thefinal draft.

We also found theregional roll-ups within the ‰ÛÏSector‰Ûchapters to be a useful summary of those impacts. In fact, ourprimary recommendation for improving the Assessment is to include a similar ‰ÛÏroll-up‰Ûsummaries thataddress biodiversity and habitat impacts of for each Sector topic.A case in point is the ‰ÛÏWater‰Ûchapter, which scarcely mentions the effects of climate changes onaquatic species and biodiversity, despite the fact that the loss and degradation of wetland, stream and other","The primary recommendation here is to include ""roll-up summaries that address biodiversity and habitat impactsof for each Sector topic.""

The report has also improved as a tool for decision support over past versions,although I doubt many decision makers will take the time for 1500 pages of information.  Some suggestions:a) The traceable accounts sections should be pulled from the text and published as a second report or anappendix.  The chapter-by-chapter sections on uncertainties are my favorite addition to the assessment, but theoverall traceable account section naturally contains some redundancies with the core report, and the text is toocumbersome at it's current length, so  splitting our the traceable accounts and shortening the core report makessense.b) I realize the authors were trying not to tell the research community what to study, but hints at critical gaps indata or understanding occur throughout the report (e.g pg 316, lines 12-14; p 430, lines 35-36; pg 590, lines 26-30) and Chapter 29 has a unique format with a section on ""Directions for Future Research"".  The chapter authorsmust currently have a strong sense of what the critical gaps are in data and understanding that, if corrected,would significantly improve uncertainties in NCA-5.

On the issue of CDR and SRM, they need to beconsidered in the context of using all approaches available in a coordinated way and not considered as possiblesingle cures on their own--we are far too along in climate change to be thinking that way as seems to be done inthe very limited coverage this issue gets in this whole assessment. While I thought it a good idea to have a firstattempt at considering effects of climate change on US interests outside the US, a couple of suggestions for thenext report. First, it would have been interesting to think about how changes occurring in the US might affectother nations. Second, I did not see anything on how changes in one region are likely to affect other regions, so,for example, how rising sea level and the increasing discomfort index across the Southeast, for example, mightdrive internal migration in the US from the Southeast to other regions in the country.","We discuss geoengineering briefly in Chapter 29 (Mitigation), but a more detailed discussion was deemedoutside the scope of this current assessment.

Michael,MacCracken,144585,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"As an editorial comment, I'd like to suggest that the phrase ""climate change"" (singular) be used as the term todescribe the entirety of what is happening since pre-industrial times (so mainly human-induced), and that thephrase ""climate changes"" not be used to refer to the specific changes in the climate that might affect a particularspecies or system--to describe those specific changes, I'd suggest using ""changes in climate"" (or even ""changesin the weather induced by climate change) to describe changes in the array of climate parameters. It justseemed to me that using the phrase ""climte changes"" gets confusing--one has ""scenarios of climate change"",etc. [Also, I'd suggest not saying ""future scenarios of climate change"" as scenarios are about the future and wehave these scenarios now.] I do realize that there are complaints about using ""climate change"" generally torefer to human-induced climate change because there have indeed been naturally induced changes in the past,so it might be that when referring to human-induced climate change that this whole phrase might need to beuse, even though this does seem to rule out consideration of the natural influence on recent climate alsomeriting consideration.

We have made every effort toclarify language and maintain consistency throughout the report, while keeping scientific accuracy andcommunication to a broad audience in mind. We decided to maintain a generic usage of the term ""climatechange"", so there is no inherent implication of natural or human causes nor is there any inherent implication oftiming (since preindustrial times or otherwise). Instead of attaching specific meaning to these generic terms, wedecided to clarify their meanings on a case-by-case basis. Additionally, we have taken the commenter's adviceto avoid usage of the term ""future scenarios""."
Michael,MacCracken,144586,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"Given the effort put in to creating the likelihood and confidence lexicons, there nees to be a scrub of thedocument done to really try to enforce the use of the lexicons. Many of my specific comments are about using aword from the lexicon instead of using the word ""may"" (and also the word ""could"") which provide no sense at allof likelihood--almost anything may happen. Reworking the phrasing can sometimes require adding a conditionalphrase, so, for example, saying 'If [this or that] is not done, then it is [likely or unlikely] that [this or that will occuror will result.' This need to scrub assessments of the word ""may"" and equivalents was learned in the firstassessment when a well-known Washington Post columnist wrote a story on a draft of the assessment andoffered an interpretation that was far from what was intended because there were so many things that weresaid ""may"" happen. Since then, at least, good assessment practice is to avoid using such uninformative words asthey allow vastly different readings of the findings. I have so many comments in my specific comments aboutthis there may be an author uprising, but I think fixing it would be better than adjusting the lexicon and sayingthat ""may"" means about equally one way or not (so a synonym for ""possible"") because, in reading through thereport, there were many places where it was clear from the context that ""is likely to"" was what was meant.","We developed additional writing guidance for the authors in light of this (and related comments) providingexamples of how to avid the use of ""future conditionals"" such as ""may"" or ""could"".  The revised draft, therefore,has far fewer instances where thesse unhelpful and vague phrases are used.  We also took care to ensure thecalibrated uncertainty language (e.g., ""likely"", ""very likely:, etc.) were not used in the text unless it wasspecifically in the context of the calibrated uncertainty language as presented in the Front Matter."
Michael,MacCracken,144626,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"Point of Information: I thought it very helpful to have the ""Traceable Account"" sections, but due to timeconstraints, I had to focus my comments on the main texts of the chapters, hopeful that comments made onthose sections might be carried on back to the ""Traceable Account"" section.",We agree and made sure that changes to the text got reflected in the traceable accounts.
Michael,MacCracken,144658,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"With respect to the word ""drought"", it usually refers to a reduction in water availability for some limite, finitetime, with recovery being expected. We do not say, for example, that the Sahara Desert is experiencing adrought just because it was vegetated several thousand years ago, etc.--it is a desert. The long term trendtoward drying in southwestern North America due to the poleward shift of the northern boundary of thesubtropics is also not a drought--it is a gradual aridification of the region and not referred to as a drought. Now,one may have some wet and dry years atop the decreasing precipitation trend, so one can have what one mightcall a drouhgt--but the general drying, the shift from having a good number of rainy years in a decade and anoccasional dry year to having mostly dry years and an occasional wet year is not drought--that trend isaridification. I make this point because how one responds really depends--if we are going to have a few dryyears and a return to mostly wet years, then larger reservoirs is a plausible response; however, if there will notbe that return to extended patterns of wet years and most years will be dry (so aridification), then largerreservoirs is not a useful step--what is needed are actions to reduce per capita demand, so efficiency, xeric land-scalping, shifts away from water-demanding crops, etc. I would urge inclusion of a box somewhere explainingthis and then encouraging authors to be using the appropriate terms, because right now, drought is the wordbeing used to explain both the trend and short-term variations, and decision makers and resource managersreally need to be provided clear information on this.","Additional guidance was given to authors to clarify how they use the term ""drought"" in their respective chapters.As a default, the definition as it appears in the USGCRP glossary (https://www.globalchange.gov/climate-change/glossary) is used.  We state as much in the Front Matter.  ""Drought"" is defined in the USGCRP glossaryas: ""A period of abnormally dry weather marked by little or no rain that lasts long enough to cause watershortage for people and natural systems."""
Michael,MacCracken,144659,"WholeDocument",,,,,,,"Another point that needs to be made is that while this assessment looks out across the 21st century, changeswill continue thereafter. For sea level, for example, it is going to keep rising well past 2100 and the focus on sealevel rise in 2100 in the report is rarely accompanied by mention that sea level rise will continue thereafter. Yes,useful to be aware of what the worst case might be for 2100, but in presenting such information, it needs to bementioned that the indicated level is likely at or below the middle level expected (or that could plausibly occur)by 2150, so a generation or two later. I'd encourage some early discussion on this point and then a way for thechapter authors to refer to it in stating that sea level rise will go on beyond 2100. Similarly, though to someextent dependent on policy actions during the 21st century, there will be ongoing climate change after 2100 ifthe current pace of emissions cutbacks is not very greatly speeded up. So, I'd like to see some attention to theissue of beyond 2100, perhaps in a box somewhere--and references made from the chapters to that box.","Sea level rise past 2100 is discussed in Chapter 2, as well as in NCA4 Vol. 1 Chapter 15 and Chapter 4.  We havealso included reference to some impacts that extend beyond 2100 in the Overview.
