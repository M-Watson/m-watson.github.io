At some point after leaving grad school and starting to work I realized I was no longer reading. For work I was reading a lot but I was no longer really following my interests and did not read for personal exploration or entertainment. So in mid 2018 (according to the created date on a file I use to track everything) I decided to find a way to re-start a reading habit. I wanted to make sure I wasn't spending a whole bunch of time just coming up with some crazy method to start reading more so I went simple. I started a document to track what books I started and finished and set a goal for at least reading one book a month. This felt like a decent starting pace. 

Since I have been wanting to start writing more I decided this December I am going to go back through the books I have read and just write down thoughts. Some things I plan on exploring is just what I thought about the books (or remember really at this point). Along with that it might be fun to explore what months I have read more, are there trends, are there themes? Really anything that pops out while I go back in time. So here is to seeing if I can keep this up and start a writing habit, because my simple approach to reading has reinvigorated my love of reading and created a lasting habit.
