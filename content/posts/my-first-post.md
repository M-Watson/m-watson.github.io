Well here we are again, we as in just me since I can't imagine anyone has stumbled onto this page before. I decided to go back to a base Hugo to streamline the publishing process since I made a huge mess out of the directory structure before. I will probably start getting back into my custom layouts but using the Hugo approach so everything doesn't get all messed up again.

I do plan on writing more, which is why I wanted to restart this. I think I need to focus on just getting thoughts, interests, little rabbit holes down as a matter of practice will be helpful to me. Something I know will help is just knowing this doesn't need to be fully polished and can be published just as thoughts. I think the habit will be more useful for me than anything else.
