       <h4><b>Wearable Technologies for Law Enforcement: Multifunctional Vest System Options</b></h4>
       <p>This report is part of an ongoing research program, led by the RAND Corporation and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, with the objective of identifying high-priority research needs to provide options to criminal justice agencies (including law enforcement, courts, and corrections) that can contribute to effective and efficient performance of their missions. Its focus on wearable technologies for law enforcement is based on review and analysis of high-priority technology needs previously identified in workshops with diverse groups of law enforcement practitioners and academics, as well as other members of the criminal justice community and relevant technology developers (see, for example, Hollywood, Boon, et al., 2015; Hollywood, Woods, et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Silberglitt et al., 2015).

       <h4><b>Direct measurements of multi-photon induced nonlinear lattice dynamics in semiconductors via time-resolved x-ray scattering</b></h4>
       <p>Nonlinear optical phenomena in semiconductors present several fundamental problems in modern optics that are of great importance for the development of optoelectronic devices. In particular, the details of photo-induced lattice dynamics at early time-scales prior to carrier recombination remain poorly understood. We demonstrate the first integrated measurements of both optical and structural, material-dependent quantities while also inferring the bulk impulsive strain profile by using high spatial-resolution time-resolved x-ray scattering (TRXS) on bulk crystalline gallium arsenide. Our findings reveal distinctive laser-fluence dependent crystal lattice responses, which are not described by previous TRXS experiments or models. The initial linear expansion of the crystal upon laser excitation stagnates at a laser fluence corresponding to the saturation of the free carrier density before resuming expansion in a third</p></div>

       <h4><b>Defining the Roles, Responsibilities, and Functions for Data Scienc e Within the Defense Intelligence Agency</b></h4>
       <p>Exploiting the rapidly growing sources of data available for collection and analysis is one of the greatest professional challenges facing today’s intelligence leaders. The magnitude of potentially relevant data is overwhelming, and more data are being generated and stored every day. Whether the data originate from machines or are based on use of language, the associated analysis makes it possible to uncover important information that would otherwise remain hidden. This type of analysis was impossible only a few years ago, when less data were collected and stored digitally and when information technology systems were incapable of accommodating such large amounts of data. The question, then, is not whether to develop data science capabilities, but rather how to do so

       <h4><b>A Framework for Programming and Budgeting for Cybersecurity</b></h4>
       <p>When defending an organization against cyberattacks, cybersecurity professionals are faced with the dilemma of selecting from a large set of cybersecurity defensive measures while operating with a limited set of resources with which to employ the measures. Engaging in this selection process is not easy and can be overwhelming. Furthermore, the challenge is exacerbated by the fact that many cybersecurity strategies are presented as itemized lists, with few hints at how to position a given action within the space of alternative actions. This report aims to address these difficulties by explaining the menu of actions for defending an organization against cyberattack and recommending an approach for organizing the range of actions and evaluating cybersecurity defensive activities.

       <h4><b>Thermal conductivity of monolayer molybdenum disulfide obtained from temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy</b></h4>
       <p>Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) offers potential for advanced devices and an alternative to graphene due to its unique electronic and optical properties. The temperature-dependent Raman spectra of exfoliated, monolayer MoS2 in the range of 100–320 K are reported and analyzed. The linear temperature coefficients of the in-plane E2g1 and the out-of-plane A1g modes for both suspended and substrate-supported monolayer MoS2 are measured. These data, when combined with the first-order coefficients from laser power-dependent studies, enable the thermal conductivity to be extracted. The resulting thermal conductivity κ = (34.5 ± 4) W/mK at room temperature agrees well with the first-principles lattice dynamics simulations. However, this value is significantly lower than that of graphene. The results from this work provide important input for the design of MoS2-based devices where thermal management is critical.</p>

       <h4><b>Temperature and power dependent photothermal properties of single-layer MoS2</b></h4>
       <p> The discovery of graphene, nearly a decade ago [1, 2, 3], has since given interest into other atomically thin, two-dimensional (2D) crystals. One such material is mono-layer molybdenum disulphide (MoS2). Electronic device manufactures in particular have found 2D materials such as MoS2 interesting because of the physical and electronic properties. MoS2 can be fashioned into electronic components such as field-effect transistors (FETs) or logic gates easily and are particularly thin. This interest means MoS2 must be understood from an electronic and physical perspective before it can fully be integrated into electronic devices. To understand MoS2 better a comprehensive power and temperature dependent study on MoS2 was done using both Raman and photoluminescent spectroscopies. Mechanical ex-foliation of MoS2 from bulk provides single-layer flakes, which are then transferred either to sapphire substrates or suspended over holes in Si/Si3N4. We measure temperature dependence from ~~100K to 400K and power dependence from ~~6 uW to ~~7mW using an Argon laser at 514.5nm and a HeNe laser at 632.8 nm. Raman spectroscopy was used for initial identification of a single-layer flake of MoS2. In MoS2 when the two Raman peaks, the A1g and E1 2g are less than 18 cm-1 the flake is considered single layer.[4] The thermal conductivity of MoS2 was experimentally extracted from Raman temperature and power measurements using linear coefficients, xT and xP , for temperature and power dependence of the peak position respectively.[5] This value of thermal conductivity K was calculated to be ~~34.5 Wm-1 K-1.[5] Temperature

       <h4><b>EPICS oscilloscope for time-resolved data acquisition</b></h4>
       <p> The Sector 7 undulator beamline (7 ID) of the Advanced Photon Source (APS) is dedicated to time-resolved X-ray research [1]. Silicon avalanche photodiodes (APDs) are used as the primary point detector for time-resolved Bragg diffraction experiments for their fast recovery time (&lt;100 ns) and ability to observe single photon events. For experiments with high photon ﬂux (≥105 photons/s) at the detector, however, deadtime corrections to the counting statistics become appreciable [2]. Common practice has been to attenuate the monochromatic beam entering the experimental hutch to an appropriately low ﬂux [3]. For these high-ﬂux experiments, an APD operated in proportional mode is a better detector choice due to a large dynamic range and linearity. With the ZT4212 ZTEC, EPICS based oscilloscope, the operating procedure to use an APD in proportional mode has been improved. This article shows the setup
