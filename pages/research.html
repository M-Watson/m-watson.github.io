       <h4><b>Thermal conductivity of monolayer molybdenum disulfide obtained from temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy</b></h4>
       <p>Atomically thin molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) offers potential for advanced devices and an alternative to graphene due to its unique electronic and optical properties. The temperature-dependent Raman spectra of exfoliated, monolayer MoS2 in the range of 100–320 K are reported and analyzed. The linear temperature coefficients of the in-plane E2g1 and the out-of-plane A1g modes for both suspended and substrate-supported monolayer MoS2 are measured. These data, when combined with the first-order coefficients from laser power-dependent studies, enable the thermal conductivity to be extracted. The resulting thermal conductivity κ = (34.5 ± 4) W/mK at room temperature agrees well with the first-principles lattice dynamics simulations. However, this value is significantly lower than that of graphene. The results from this work provide important input for the design of MoS2-based devices where thermal management is critical.</p>

       <h4><b>Wearable Technologies for Law Enforcement: Multifunctional Vest System Options</b></h4>
       <p>This report is part of an ongoing research program, led by the RAND Corporation and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, with the objective of identifying high-priority research needs to provide options to criminal justice agencies (including law enforcement, courts, and corrections) that can contribute to effective and efficient performance of their missions. Its focus on wearable technologies for law enforcement is based on review and analysis of high-priority technology needs previously identified in workshops with diverse groups of law enforcement practitioners and academics, as well as other members of the criminal justice community and relevant technology developers (see, for example, Hollywood, Boon, et al., 2015; Hollywood, Woods, et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Silberglitt et al., 2015). The implementation of wearable electromagnetic devices for sensing, tracking, video recording, or biomedical...</p></div>
