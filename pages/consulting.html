       <h4><b>Wearable Technologies for Law Enforcement: Multifunctional Vest System Options</b></h4>
       <p>This report is part of an ongoing research program, led by the RAND Corporation and sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, with the objective of identifying high-priority research needs to provide options to criminal justice agencies (including law enforcement, courts, and corrections) that can contribute to effective and efficient performance of their missions. Its focus on wearable technologies for law enforcement is based on review and analysis of high-priority technology needs previously identified in workshops with diverse groups of law enforcement practitioners and academics, as well as other members of the criminal justice community and relevant technology developers (see, for example, Hollywood, Boon, et al., 2015; Hollywood, Woods, et al., 2015; Jackson et al., 2015; Silberglitt et al., 2015). The implementation of wearable electromagnetic devices for sensing, tracking, video recording, or biomedical...</p></div>
